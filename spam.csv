ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE
MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR
BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON
(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I
WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY
REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN
CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.
FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX
NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE.BEST REGARDS,MRS M. SESE SEKO

Kenya Airbus (A310-300) flight KQ430 in November2000.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next of kin tocome

our
bank, other wisethe fund will be returned to the bank treasury as unclaimed
fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 30%for
you as
foreign partner and 70% for us the officials in my department.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, my colleague and I
willcome to
your country and mind our share. It is from our 60% we intendto import
computer

your capability.  Upon completion of this transaction
I have decided to give you 30% of the total sum, 60%
of the fund which is our share will be used for
investment in your company or in any other company of
our choice. While10% has been mapped out to take care
of any minor expenses incurred. Take note that this

Give Away FREE CD's - Earn $5K in 30 Days!,stats@websitetracker.com,"Serious@no.hostname.supplied, Partners@no.hostname.supplied","Fri, 23 Aug 2002 04:30:48 +0900","This is the bottom line.  If you can GIVE AWAY CD's for FREE to people (like 80-100 in one month) and then let ME talk to them FOR you - if you can GIVE AWAY free product samples -  then YOU can earn $5,000 in the next 30 - 45 days.

Think I'm kidding?  We earned PRECISELY $26,087.58 in our first 94 days doing JUST that - and we scanned our checks online for you to see them with your own eyes!  We've TWEAKED things a little because WE DON'T WANT you to talk to ANYONE.  WE WANT to talk to people FOR YOU.

if you are ....
VERY BUSY or,
Aren't GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE or,
DON'T WANT to talk to people....

Then let US work FULL TIME for you.  We've helped others....
   Julie P. earned $750 in one week with us
   Jeff A. earned $6500 in 5 weeks with us

And we NOW have an EXACT business plan for you and can tell you EXACTLY what to expect with where you're starting.  No guesswork - we've done it.

And if you DO want to seriously evaluate this, we would be HAPPY to even fly you to Los Angeles at OUR expense to get a closer look!  NO KIDDING!

급여가 상대적으로 높고 주5일제 근무에 앞서있는 '외국계 은행'이, IT분야는 '게임'분야가, 방송분야는 요즘
신세대 대학생들이 가장 선호하는 직업인 홈쇼핑의 '쇼핑호스트'와 케이블방송의 'VJ'를, 뷰티/패션분야는 美에
대한 관심고조로 인해 '피부관리사' 또는 '스타일리스트', 인테리어/건축분야에서는 리모델링 붐에 힘입어
'인테리어'쪽이 높은 순위로 꼽혔다.</SPAN></FONT>

수요가 많아지고 있으며, 신입직의 채용 또한 많아지고 있다. 올 하반기까지 인력시장은 맑음

있을수록 좋다. 금융권에서 유용하게 쓰이는 자격증으로는 투자상담사, 금융자산관리사(FP),
재무위험관리사(FRM) 등. 특히 증권사에 근무할 이들이라면 투자상담사나 금융자산관리사의 자격증은 기본이 되고
있으니 반드시 취득해두도록 하자. <IMG height=10

DOES ALL THIS MEAN TO YOU? EASY MONEY!!<BR><BR>Let's assume that every person 
has only one E-mail address...<BR>that's 500 million potential customers and 
growing!� In addition,<BR>E'mail is without question the most powerful 
method of distributing<BR>information on the face of the earth.<BR><BR>Well, I 
think you get the picture.� The numbers and potential are <BR>just 
staggering, but it gets even better...<BR><BR>Suppose I told you that you could 
start your own E-mail business<BR>today and enjoy these 
benefits:<BR><BR>���� *** All Customers Pay You In 
Cash!!!<BR>���� *** You Will Sell A Product Which Costs 
Nothing to Produce!<BR>���� *** Your Only Overhead Is Your

Customers!!!<BR>���� *** You Get Detailed, Easy To Follow 
Startup 
Instructions!<BR><BR>��������� AND 
THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG . . .<BR>As you read on you'll discover how 
a 'Seen on National TV' <BR>program is paying out a half million dollars, every 
4 to 5 months<BR>from your home, for an investment of only $25 US Dollars 
expense,<BR>one time.� ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE . . . <BR>AND THE 
INTERNET!<BR><BR>Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following:<BR>This is 
the letter you have been hearing about on the news<BR>lately.� Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet,<BR>a national weekly news program 
recently devoted an entire<BR>show to the investigation of this program 
described below,<BR>to see if it really can make people money.<BR><BR>The show 
also investigated whether or not the program was<BR>legal.� Their findings 
proved once and for all that there are<BR>""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the 
participation in the<BR>program and if people can follow the simple 
instructions,<BR>they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out 
of<BR>pocket cost"".<BR><BR>���� DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE

<BR>the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.� I followed the<BR>simple 
instructions and walaa. . . .� 3 weeks later the money<BR>started to come 
in.� First month I only made $240.00 but the<BR>next 2 months after that I 
made a total of $290,000.00.<BR>So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I <BR>have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again.<BR><BR>The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple<BR>steps and NOT change 
anything.""<BR><BR>More testimonials later but first:<BR><BR>** PRINT THIS NOW

report.<BR><BR>���� MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
YOUR<BR>���� ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any 
mail<BR>���� problems.<BR><BR>���� 
*****When you place your order, make 
sure<BR>�������������� 
you order each of the 5 reports *****<BR><BR>You will need all 5 reports so that 
you can save them on your<BR>computer and resell them.<BR><BR>YOUR TOTAL COST $5 
X 5 = $25.00<BR><BR>**********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, 
each<BR>of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.� Save<BR>them 
on your computer so they will be accessible for you to<BR>send to the 1,000's of 
people who will order them from you.<BR>Also make a floppy of these reports and 
keep it at your desk<BR>in case something happens to your 
computer.<BR><BR>**********IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the 
people<BR>who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the <BR>list, 
in any way other than what is intructed below in steps<BR>1 through 6 or you 
will lose out on the majority of your profits.<BR>Once you understand the way 
this works, you will also see how<BR>it does not work if you change 
it.<BR><BR>Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,<BR>it will 
NOT work!!!<BR><BR>People have tried to put their friends/relatives names 
on<BR>all five thinking they could get all the money.� But it does<BR>not 
work this way.� Believe us, we have tried to be greedy<BR>and then nothing 
happened.<BR><BR>So do not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed.<BR>Because if you do, it will not work for you.� 
Remember,<BR>honesty reaps the reward!!!<BR><BR>1. After you have ordered all 5 
reports, take this <BR>advertisement and REMOVE the name and address of the 
person in<BR>REPORT # 5.� This person has made it through the cycle and is 
<BR>no doubt counting their fortune.<BR><BR>2. Move the name & address in 
REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.<BR>3. Move the name & address in REPORT #3 down 
to REPORT #4.<BR>4. Move the name & address in REPORT #2 down to REPORT 
#3.<BR>5. Move the name & address in REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.<BR>6. 
Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT #1 Position.<BR><BR>PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & 
address<BR>ACCURATELY!<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Take 
this entire letter, with the modified list of names,<BR>and save it on your 
computer.� DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER<BR>CHANGES.� Save this on a disk as 
well just in case you loose<BR>any data.<BR><BR>To assist you with marketing 
your business on the Internet,<BR>the 5 reports you purchase will provide you 
with invaluable<BR>marketing information that includes:� How to send bulk 
e-mails<BR>legally, Where to find thousand of free classified ads and <BR>much, 
much more.<BR><BR>There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture 
going:<BR><BR>�� METHOD #1:� SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY<BR>�� 
---------------------------------------------------------<BR>Let's say that you 
decide to start small, just to see how<BR>it goes, and we'll assume you and 
those involved send out<BR>only 5,000 emails each.� Let's also assume that 
the mailing<BR>receives only a 0.2% response (the response could be 
much<BR>better but lets just say it is only 0.2%.� Also, many 
people<BR>will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of<BR>only 
5,000 each).<BR><BR>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 
e-mails.<BR>With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for Report #1.<BR>Those 
10 people resonded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each<BR>for a total of 
50,000.� Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%<BR>responded with 
orders.� That's 100 people responded and<BR>ordered Report #2.� Those 
100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails<BR>each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.� 
The 0.2% response to <BR>that is 1000 orders for Report #3.<BR><BR>Thoe 1000 
people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of<BR>5 million e-mails sent 
out.� The 0.2% response to that is<BR>10,000 orders for Report #4.� 
Those 10,000 people send out<BR>5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 
million)<BR>e-mails.� the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for<BR>Report #5.<BR><BR>THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = 500,000<BR>(a 
half a million).<BR><BR>���� Your total income in this 
example is:<BR>���� 1......$50 +<BR>���� 
2......$500 +<BR>���� 3......$5,000 
+<BR>���� 4......$50,000 +<BR>���� 
5......$500,000 .................. Grand Total = 
$555,550.00<BR><BR>���� NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.� GET A 
PENCIL & PAPER AND<BR>���� FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE 
RESPONSES AND <BR>���� NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU 
WILL<BR>���� STILL MAKE A LOT OF 
MONEY!<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>���� 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10<BR>���� PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.<BR><BR>Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone,<BR>or 1/2, or even 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails<BR>each or more?� There are over 250 million people on the 
<BR>Internet worldwide and counting.� Believe me, many people<BR>will do 
just that, and more!<BR><BR>���� METHOD #2:� PLACING 
FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<BR>��� 
<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Advertising 
on the net is very, very inexpensive and there<BR>are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise.� Placing a lot of<BR>free ads on the internet will easily get a 
larger response.<BR>We strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add 
METHOD<BR># 2 as you go along.<BR><BR>For every $5 you receive, all you must do 
is e-mail them the <BR>Report they ordered.� That's it!� Always 
provide same day<BR>service on all orders.� This will guarantee that the 
e-mails<BR>they send out, with your name and address on it, will be<BR>prompt 
because they can not advertise until they receive 
the<BR>report.<BR><BR>���� ORDER EACH REPORT BY IT NUMBER 
& NAME ONLY.<BR><BR>Note:� Always send $5 cash (US Currency) for each 
report.<BR>Checks are NOT accepted.� Make sure the cash is wrapped in<BR>at 
lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope.<BR>On one of those 
sheets of paper, write the NUMBER and the NAME<BR>of the Report you are 
ordering, your email ADDRESS, your NAME<BR>and postal address.� Make sure 
you affix the proper 'International'<BR>Postage if ordering a report from 
outside your country.<BR><BR>���� PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

live in Chicago.<BR>I am an accountant with a major US Corporation and I 
make<BR>pretty good money.� When I received this program I grumbled<BR>to 
Jody about receiving ""junk mail"".� I made fun of the<BR>whole thing, 
spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved.� I 
""knew"" it wouldn't work.� Jody<BR>totally ignored my supposed intelligence 
and a few days later<BR>she jumped in with both feet.� I made merciless fun 
of her,<BR>and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her when<BR>the thing 
didn't work.� Well, the laugh was on me!� Within<BR>3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses.� Within the next 45<BR>days she had received a total 
of $147,200.00 all cash!<BR>I was shocked.� I have joined Jody in her 
""hobby"".<BR><BR>���� Mitchell Wof,� Chicago, 
Illinois<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>make up my mind to 
participate in this plan.� But conservative<BR>that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little<BR>that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders<BR>to at least get my money back.� I was 
surprised when I found<BR>my medium sized post office box crammed with 
orders.� I made<BR>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.� The nice thing 
about this<BR>deal is that it does not matter where people live.� 
There<BR>simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and<BR>so 
big"".<BR><BR>���� Dan Sondstrom,� Alberta, 
Canada<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""I 
had received this program before.� I deleted it, but later<BR>I wondered if 
I should hav given it a try.� Of course, I<BR>had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to<BR>wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else 
. . . . . . . <BR>11 months passed then it luckily came again.� I did not 
<BR>delete this one!� I made more than $490,000 on my first try<BR>and all 
the money came within 22 weeks"".<BR><BR>���� Susan De 
Suza,�� New York,

really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy<BR>money with little cost 
to you.� I followed the simple<BR>instructions carefully and within 10 days

      TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROGRAM<br>
      Anyone, young or old, male or female, anywhere in<br>
      the United States can easily earn great money<br>
      participating in our Pamphlet Processing Program!<br>
      The reason why our program does not require any<br>
      experience is simple... it does not take any previous<br>
      experience to fold a pamphlet, insert it into an envelope,<br>
      and seal an envelope. Plus, our program is especially<br>
      beneficial for people who need to earn a serious<br>
      extra income but might not have the spare time for<br>
      a second job.<br>
      As stated, just a few hours per day could possibly<br>
      earn you well over $500.00 per week... NO JOKE!<br>
      Just imagine how nice it would be if you could<br>
      earn an extra $500.00 to $1,500.00 per week<br>
      working from your home...no more annoying<br>
      boss...no more hectic rush hour commuting...no<br>
      more stressful 9 to 5 job, and no more headaches !<br>
      <br>
      <b><i><font color=""#0000FF"">FACT</font></i><br>
      </b>Practically every type of person can benefit<br>
      financially from our Pamphlet Processing Program.<br>

      Manual is 100% Legal and Legitimate! In fact,<br>
      there are hundreds of lawyers and attorneys all<br>
      over the country using this valuable information<br>
      and charging people big money to remove negative<br>
      and incorrect items from their credit files!<br>
      However, our Credit Repair Manual explains how<br>
      people can do the VERY SAME THING that these<br>
      costly attorneys are doing except our credit<br>
      repair manual shows people how to repair their<br>

      Therefore, to get started immediately, all that<br>
      our company requires is a one-time refundable<br>
      order-processing fee of only $45.<br>
      Please understand, we cannot afford to<br>
      send out a package of valuable materials to<br>
      everyone interested in our program. And also keep<br>
      in mind that once you process 100 pamphlets you<br>
      will have already earned your $45 back and are<br>
      left with an extra $55 profit !!!<br>
      <br>
      We must charge a small processing fee to<br>
      ensure that only serious individuals intend to<br>
      participate in our program.&nbsp; Keep in mind, you<br>
      NEVER have to pay us any other fees and you can<br>
      participate for as long as you wish! This fee<br>
      simply assures our company that you are indeed<br>
      serious about our program and the opportunity to<br>
      make good money working from your home. Sorry, we<br>
      CAN NOT process your order form without the<br>
      one-time processing fee since there are far<br>
      too many serious individuals willing to pay this<br>
      small one-time fee in order to participate in our<br>
      high profit work-at-home program. Therefore, all<br>
      you have to do is just complete, print, sign, and<br>
      send in the Order Form (FORM AGM-222: 16.F).<br>
      <br>
      Please, be sure to complete the Order Form IN<br>
      FULL, legible, with your correct shipping address<br>
      in order to prevent any processing delays in<br>
      the shipment of your package. That's right, if you<br>
      are really looking for a 100% LEGAL and LEGITIMATE<br>
      home based income opportunity we can honestly say<br>
      that you have finally found the right company with<br>
      an honest and proven money making program!<br>

REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.,kolaowo@netscape.net,kolaowo@netscape.net,"Fri, 23 Aug 2002 14:53:09 -0400","OWOLABI & ASSOCIATE,
FALOMO, IKOYI.
LAGOS - NIGERIA.


YOUR KIND ATTN.,



RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I
represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo’s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. What
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. But before the purchase could take
place the president died. My client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand
United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.

I remain most obliged.

Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).
Principal Partner. Owolabi & Associates

Immediate Reply Needed,"""Dr.James Ologun"" <jamesalabi@mail.com>",zzzz-sa-listinfo@spamassassin.taint.org,"Sat, 24 Aug 2002 20:18:02 -0700","Dear Sir,

I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract
award and review committee set up by the federal
government of Nigeria under the new civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge
sum of money to a foreign account. 

There were series of contracts executed by a 
consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in
favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these 
contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum
of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand 
United
State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and
is now ready to be transferred being that the
companies
that actually executed these contracts have been
fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. 


Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to 
transfer the total amount to your account for
subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants
are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil
service law) from operating and/or opening foreign 
accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in 
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 
transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for
incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will
be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts
in due course. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds
within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of
the above stated terms. 
Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To 

accord this transaction the legality it deserves and
for mutual security of the funds the whole approval
procedures will officially and legally processed
with your name or the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. 
Once more I want you to understand that having put
in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my
country, I am averse to having my image and career 
dented. This matter should therefore be treated with
utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. 

Please you should signify your intention to assist
by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this
transaction, if favorable we will take further steps
to brief you the full details of this viable 
transaction. 
I want to assure you that this business proposal is
100% risk free as we have done our homework
properly. 

I quite believe that you will protect our interest
by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are
still in government service, which we intend to
retire from in full honor.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the next batch
which would constitute the new quarter payments
for the 2002 financial year. 

Thank you and God bless.

Dr James Alabi

ADV: Internet marketing & communications; earn $100k/year... uleio,bwiTim Fai <dwftan@earthlink.com>,Friend@webnote.net,"Sun, 25 Aug 2002 09:36:45 +0800","HELLO...By reading the short Summary just below, you
will see how you can learn new skills in communication,
do a direct marketing program on the internet, and at the
same time, earn $100,000 or more to enable you to
CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!

************SUMMARY***************************

Just read this Summary, follow the actions that it advises,
and start earning some serious money.  You will learn new
skills in communications and how to market on the internet.
What a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.

Step 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message,
and you have not joined in this program before, then
take out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mail
out $10.00 each to the following people to purchase five
Guides on communications.  For each Guide that you will
be ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain white
paper, your own name, address, and YOUR OWN EMAIL
ADDRESS, and the number and name of the Guide that
you are buying.  Then fold the paper, put the $10.00 bill
inside the sheet of paper, insert the paper and $10.00 bill
into an envelope, address the envelope with the name and
address of the person whose name is shown under each
Guide below, and mail the envelope by first class or air
mail. Be sure to put enough postage stamps on the
envelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.

________________________________________________
END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************

Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.

Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.

Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.

Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.

Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.

Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.

Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.

This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.

Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************

=======REST OF MESSAGE======================

With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!

READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.

= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =

If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.

===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================

Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.

Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.

Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.

Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.

If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)

If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795

If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.

There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.

METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.

The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.

===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.

PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.

=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!
===========================================
A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom to really change your life, but I don't
wish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You
can make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.

Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you
have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved
others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the
people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more
emails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember, the more you send out the more potential
buyers you will reach.

Best news yet,patricehari@yahoo.ca,Vestedge.Update@dogma.slashnull.org,"Tue, 27 Aug 2002 05:19:21 -0100","INVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. 

Research Alert - Undervalued
August 26, 2002
XrayMedia
(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8

Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! 

Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.

Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... 

Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!

How does the company do this? 

XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. 

Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.

While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.

 *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.

*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. 

*** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.

*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.

*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. 

*** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

Teach and Grow Rich,maureen5w60@mixmail.com,webmaster@efi.ie,"Wed, 28 Aug 2002 00:57:23 +0600"," 
                 Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?





If you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minutes presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  

Plus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.

Many are called, few are chosen.  This opportunity will be limited to one qualified individual per state.  Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  

                          *** 801-397-9010 *** 

Please do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.  Looking forward to your call.    

                            *** 801-397-9010 ***

[ILUG] IMPORTANT.,DR SAMUEL EBOKA <SAMUELEBOKA11@YAHOO.COM>,ilug@linux.ie,"Wed, 28 Aug 2002 11:57:10 -1200","
>>From the desk of: DR. SAMUEL EBOKA.
Tel No: Your Intl. Access Code + 873762692484
Fax No: Your Intl. Access Code + 873762692485
email : samueleboka2@email.com
Lagos, Nigeria.
Dear Sir,

IMPORTANT.

After due deliberation with my colleagues, We have decided to forward to
you this business proposal. We want a reliable 
person who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ( 
$20,500,000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World
Countries.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us
under the budget allocation to our Ministry. This 
bill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The
contract has since been executed, 
commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.
We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part 
of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for
our own use. But under our protocol division, we 
as civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This
is why we are soliciting your assistance in this 
manner and regard .

As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address
from adverts in the business directory . I am the 
Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and
TROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. 
Officials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this
Ministry. We have been exercising patience for this 
opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity
we cannot afford to miss.

We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us and I and one of my colleagues 
involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,
upon the confirmation from you that the Certified 
International Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.

Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your
interest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel 
No: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct, DO NOT add my country(234) and
City(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert 
Telephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax
you or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS 
TRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get
through.
NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please
inform us so that we can look for another reliable 
person who can assist in this respect. 

It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this
transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be 
discovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual
trust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this 
transaction. Be further informed that everyones interest and
security had been considered before you were contacted, so be rest assured
and feel free to go into this transaction with 
us.
But let Honesty and Trust be our watchword throughout this transaction and
your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. 
Thank you, and God bless.

Best Regards,

DR. SAMUEL  EBOKA.

YOUR ANTICIPATED ASSISTANT IS REQUIRED.,"""MR.IKE  EJOH"" <IKE_EJOH@YAHOO.COM>",zzzz@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 28 Aug 2002 14:41:06 +0200","I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran
ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: 

Thanks and regards. 

MR.IKE EJOH

Attn: How about being a few pounds lighter?OLIBYKN,lworks1@hotmail.com,"leftout@cac.net, jphillips@royal.net, house@cablelan.net, omalleyj@pacbell.net, m93kma@webtv.com","Thu, 29 Aug 2002 19:56:38 -1600","How are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN
HIS CLOSET!

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -
New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old
sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,
fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.

""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old
woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my
husband earns in a year"".

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where
he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away
and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet.

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of 
""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom.

""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name
on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever
15-year-old.

The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top
and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to
the top of the list.

The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and
really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues.

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.

""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a
yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I
was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to the
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"".  Over
the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.""  The
money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet, barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his bike
to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, 
fifties and hundreds.

""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks
with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the
lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a
really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next
bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any
reason to be afraid.The reporting news 

team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was
completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,
Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in
the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.

Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter
legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee.

[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What 
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
 YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you
say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the
 Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some
megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".


DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER
THAN EVER.


Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when
I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.

In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the
following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money
for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was 
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in"".

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time 
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the
mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions
and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I
only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I
have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change
anything."" More testimonials later but first,

PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE

++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE
SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT
 CORNER in case of any mail problems.

 When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.


IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority of
your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than
what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!


1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.


PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on
your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a
disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:


METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.


With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals
100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000
orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES
$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......
Grand Total=$555,550.00


NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment
what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people
mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on 
the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just
that, and more!


METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will
easily get a larger response.


We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all
orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report.

=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always
send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write
the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

+++ If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks,
continue sending e-mails until you do. =orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT #2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until
you do.

+++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will
continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different
report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you
can generate from this business!!!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS
PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few
weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works
exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your
name and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers
you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, 
materials and opportunity to become financially independent. 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
""junk mail"". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
""I told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on
me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45
days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.
I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".

Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""I was
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big"".

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I
should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone
else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete
this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money
came within 22 weeks"".

                 Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?





If you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minutes presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  

Plus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.

Many are called, few are chosen.  This opportunity will be limited to one qualified individual per state.  Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  

                          *** 801-296-4140 *** 

Please do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.  Looking forward to your call.    

                             *** 801-296-4140 ***

A CRY FOR HELP,"""MRS. M SESE SEKO"" <seko_mam@spinfinder.com>",zzzz@example.com,"Fri, 23 Aug 2002 10:15:51 -0700","DEAR FRIEND,I AM MRS.  SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
OF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.
I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS
GEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER
FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW
HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE
MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR
BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON
(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I
WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY
REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN
CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.
FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX
NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE.BEST REGARDS,MRS M. SESE SEKO

[ILUG] STOP THE MLM INSANITY,shermanm@torchlake.com,ilug@linux.ie,"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 14:18:34 -0500","Greetings! 

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time mailing, so no removal is necessary. 

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. 
The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 
The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 

Cordially, 

Mark R Sherman 

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!

FW: Make Money Fast And Legal! As Seen on TV! 65000$+,MakeMoney@EMXD.legally.com,"Business@webnote.net, Partner@zzzzason.org","Sat, 31 Aug 2002 12:57:22 +0100","THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME 
THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV 
As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. 
I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just 
simply delete it. 
READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy 
weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. 
Believe it, work it. 
This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 
4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders 
(money) 
started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a 
try!! 
You will be glad you did. 
Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't 
delete this!!! 
------------------------------------------------------ 
First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. 
PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN 
IN HIS CLOSET! 
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. 
You most likely have just seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning 
and putting laundry away when she came across a large 
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 
15-year-old sons closet. 
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 
Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 
all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", 
says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 
dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 
earns in a year"". 
The woman immediately called her husband at the 
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 
had discovered. He came home right away and they 
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 
Little did they suspect that where the money came from 
was more shocking than actually finding it in 
the closet. 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 
E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he 
obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for 
the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 
computer in his bedroom. 
""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the 
heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said 
and I started sending it out"", says the clever 
15-year-old. 
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 
on the list, then delete the address at the top and 
move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
your name to the top of the list. 
The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 
weeks if you sent out the letter with your 
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk 
E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 
going to work"", the boy continues. 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him 
for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
$5 bills. 
""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post 
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip 
that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. 
I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He 
goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a 
whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 
home and empty out my backpack because I could not 
carry it all"". 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 
out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I 
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 
barely had time for my homework"". He had also 
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 
area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. 
""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 
time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at 
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 
One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 
my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just 
rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" 
Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 
afraid. The reporting news team examined and 
investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was 
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 
at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to 
US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 
1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also 
in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
must be exchanged for money received. 
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 
little note that read, ""Please send me report number 
XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he 
was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee. 
[This is the end of the media release. If you would 
like to understand how the system works and get your 
$71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below 
is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - 
YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple 
instructions]. 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 
================================================== 
You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your 
home!! 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 
program 
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show 
also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO 
Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS 
PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. 
I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so 
glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received 
total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
=========================================================
=======Here is 
another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a 
long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this 
again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the 
simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 
come 
in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 
made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 
the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first: 
===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======== 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$ 
If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily 
and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and 
AGAIN!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$ 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME 
TRUE, GUARANTEED! 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
================= 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 
reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will 
be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 
in case something happens to your computer. 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed 
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 
than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 
loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, 
this 
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 
could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all 
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change 
anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 
work for you. 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. 
This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 
=========================================================
======= 
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist 
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 
free 
classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 
venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
=========================================================
======= 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 
response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many 
people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 
of 50,000. 
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 
people responded and ordered Report # 2. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 
for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 
total of 
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 
orders for 
Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million). 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 
Total=$555,550.00 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE 
WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL 
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
=========================================================
======= 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 
OUT 
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide 
and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
=========================================================
======= 
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the 
Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 
start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you 
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's 
it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue 
advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN 
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will 
continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your 
name 
is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME 
SEND 
ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS 
AGAIN. There is NO 
LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! 
=========================================================
======= 
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you financial freedom 
for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. 
You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have 
ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change 
it 
in 
any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 
as 
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. 
Remember 
though, the more you send out the more potential customers! you will 
reach. So 
my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and 
opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! 
====================== MORE 
TESTIMONIALS====================== 
'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 
the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 
with 
both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was 
on me! 
Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she 
had 
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have 
joined 
Jody in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
=========================================================
======= '' Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided 
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 
I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised 
when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made 
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is 
that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better 
investment 
with a faster return and so big''. 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
=========================================================
======= '' I had 
received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who 
to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed 
again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 
again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my 
first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
=========================================================
====== 
'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 
362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

We offer products that millions of people absolutely must have

Why is that so important?

What do you do when you run out of toilet paper?

of our products, every time they run out  they come back
to US to GET MORE.  We work with them one time but we get paid
over and over again!

you are in the right place.

KEVIN GEORGE

ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIE
WEST AFRICA

Dearest one,

Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebels
in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.

Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next
of kin to my father.

But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a
time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping
me to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.
Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684
I remain yours sincerely,

KEVIN GEORGE

Business Proposal.,barristerbassey@arabia.com,confidential_proposal@mail.com,"Tue, 03 Sep 2002 21:57:56 -0700","BASSEY& ASSOCIATES
FALOMO, IKOYI.
LAGOS - NIGERIA.

FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,

RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents
does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji
Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security
advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. 

With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under
the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last
military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to
the confines of his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal
that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a
security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's
portfolio during his tenure
as chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was that
he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit
with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could
take place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this for
himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he
cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that
can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for
the execution of this endeavour are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six Hundred
Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of
interest to you,you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we
can go 
through the rudiments of this endeavour.

I remain most obliged.

Barrister Williams Bassey (JP).
Principal Partner.- Bassey & Associates

[ILUG] assistance needed,bulawa mulete jr <bulawa123@cheerful.com>,ilug@linux.ie,"Thu, 05 Sep 2002 02:00:11 -0000","ATTN:

I am Bulawa Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, 
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
Forward to coming over to your country to invest our
Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.

NOTE: DO REPLY TO bulmulete@golfemail.com


God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.

URGENT ASSISTANCE(CONFIDENTIAL),matuda steven <stevenmatuda@yahoo.com>,denitto@llamas.net,"Sat, 31 Aug 2002 09:41:43 -0700","Dear sir,,


My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo
Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South
African Information exchange Johannesburg.
.

Due to the previous war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters
to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he
ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all
their farms to his party members and his followers. My
father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman
behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our
country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the
presidnt MUGABE. The president�s supporters invaded my
father�s farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested
him and confiscated all his investment.

Early last year when this victimization of white
farmers by president Mugabe started, my late father
envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all
his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of
Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.
When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a
private security company through the help of his
lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real
contents of the box to the security company, then,
went back home. He registered the box as family
treasure.

While he was still in detention that led to his death
due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South
Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in
Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He
was arrested on the 5th of March last year.
Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of
December 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.

Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and
depressing because my father�s lawyer is presently
hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;
though the lodgment documents are with me, as such I
want to relocate to your country for good. Presently,
my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum
permit as a refugee.

I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the
money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of
this country to your country for investment. If you
think you can help me, Please try to get in touch with
me immediately with the  number below . Your
compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated
if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my
country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep
this information to yourself and secret, because I
wouldn�t want anything that will expose me, and the
existence of this money.

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

STEVEN DUBA (DR).

This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. 

Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

<P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">It would be much more useful to the industry, if SPFA would help find a ""CODE CONFORMING"" fire barrier for attics, crawl spaces etc., than&nbsp; lecture on Fast and Loose applications of code.&nbsp; Something about 30 cents (a BD. FT.) installed, meeting All codes and spray applied. Many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect BUT they haven't spent the money to test over foam. Maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products, report results to SPFA, who in turn will ""acquire funding"" from US.</P>

<P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">I'm sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a ""thermal Barrier"". What the hell do you think foam is? If you are saying that anything that can be FORCED to burn should be covered with a FIREPROOF barrier, then you'd better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely NOT carrying a class one fire rating. This double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT.&nbsp; IT DOESN'T BURN ALONE. IT DOESN'T MELT. IT DOESN'T EMIT PHOSGENE. Does it smoke in a fire situation? Sure, so what?</P>
<P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt""><BR>Blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car. Get real, inspectors. You want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that DOESN'T BURN!<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">As for the vaunted R rating system, IT IS TOTALLY BOGUS. The test is designed to make porous insulations APPEAR to perform better than they actually do.&nbsp; Measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer, the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago, along with that obsolete fiberglass<BR>garbage they're still selling everybody.&nbsp; There's a reason they don't make refrigerators, freezers coolers &amp; coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it.</P>

We Buy Renewal Commissions,IQ - TWG <twg@insiq.us>,zzzz@spamassassin.taint.org,"Fri, 06 Sep 2002 18:35:32 -0400"," If you need capital for your business or want to know how much it's
worth,

renewal commissions from the following product lines: Long Term Care,
Medicare Supplement, Specified Disease, Life, and Health insurance.

Previous News Releases and Announcements Their statements are set forth in italicized orange type; our replies are in black type. June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: 
""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation."" 
""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) 
The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) 
Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 
miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** 
(Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) 
**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** 
(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and 
the same could be said for DOM. 
**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** 
(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** 
(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) 
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the 
owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** 
Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made 
possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. 
**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries.

June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. 
""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" 
http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. 
The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: 
**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** 
Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the 
northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. 
The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" 
**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. 
The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** 
Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios 
succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. 
The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999)

June 1, 1999: News Release
Part One Background: 
On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": 
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: �� �� exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). 
�� �� was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, 
Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. 
�� �� was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution 
of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. �� �� has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek �� �� has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as 
- now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political
boundaries."" 
�� �� exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and 
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. �� �� has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political 
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: 
�� �� also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo 
Convention (1933). 
�� �� was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, 
which included the United States, China and the USSR. �� �� was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. �� �� has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. �� �� has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. �� �� exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. �� �� has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of 
EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. 
Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: 
""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
Part Two Background: 
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC, February 1999, states as follows: 
""Where Are OFCs Located? 
[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. 
The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less. For further information and links to documents, see: EnenKio Documents http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/ml_intro.html http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/index.html March 16, 1999: News Release 
The impact of the passing on December 10 of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, First Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak Atolls of the Marshall Islands, beloved husband and father, was felt throughout the society.�� Flags were flown at half mast for a week 
in the Marshalls and for a a month at EnenKio Consulates around the world.�� His remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the highest ranking chiefs, according to Marshallese custom. �� His Majesty King Remios Hermios 
Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.�� His 
Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls. His successor is designated to be his brother, HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios. For further information, contact the State Secretary back on the home page. SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE 
March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.�� The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.�� The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.�� Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.�� Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.�� The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.�� It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.�� While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.�� The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.�� Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.�� The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. 
While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.�� The refusal of 
the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.�� Your understanding is appreciated.��

December 19, 1998: News Release 
Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio 
The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace.

July 14, 1998: Communiqu�� to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. 
The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'��tre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to 
the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org 
Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. 
The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers.

May 4, 1997: News Release 
Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps 
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. 
BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. 
A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. 
""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. 
CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace.

March 31, 1997: News Release 
An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. 
This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. 
The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. 
However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. 
Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: �� �� ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable 
accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". �� �� ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" 
�� �� ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every 
action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" 
�� �� ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior �� �� ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" �� �� That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". 
The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

February 6, 1995: News Release 
On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 
2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. 
An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. 
On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. 
Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. 
Request for Media Response: 
The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 
1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 
2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 
3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 
4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 
5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 
6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) 
Parting Shot: 
What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry.

November 21, 1994: News Release 
In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. 
The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. 
While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. 
Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. 
Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: �� �� Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. 
�� �� In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed 
Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. �� �� Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. �� �� A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land.

Wall Street's dirty little secret ...,jeremya@msn.com,webmaster@efi.ie,"Sun, 08 Sep 2002 23:07:56 +1000","It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

What Warren Buffett won't tell ya ...,arnoldm@aol.com,webmaster@efi.ie,"Tue, 10 Sep 2002 04:13:50 -1100","It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

[ILUG-Social] urgent assistance,"""Mr. EDWARD MULETE"" <jdmulete@netscape.net>",social@linux.ie,"Mon, 09 Sep 2002 23:16:35 -0000","ATTN:

I am Edward Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara 
Got your contact through her private search.
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
Forward to coming over to your country to invest our
Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.

Please do not use the reply button, reply only to 

Edmulete7@netscape.net Please take note.

God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.

Mr. EDWARD MULETE

DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER
FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW
HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE
MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR
BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON
(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I
WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY
REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN
CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.
FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX
NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE.BEST REGARDS,MRS M. SESE SEKO

First, I must apologise to you for using this medium to communicate to you
about this project.

I am a highly placed official of  Government of Nigeria and also a
founding member of the ruling party in Power now,the Peoples Democratic
Party(PDP).

My committee - The Niger Delta Development Corporation(NDDC)-which is in
charge of managing and supervising  the disbursement of oil sales revenues
for the Nigerian government.The revenues  under our control runs into
several hundred of millions of dollars monthly.My self and   
other colleagues in the NDDC are currently in need of a foreign partner
with whose bank account we shall transfer the sum of Forty Nine Million
Five Hundred Thosand United States Dollars($49.5m).This fund accrued to us
as commission for oil sales contracts handled under our supervision.

The fund is presently waiting in the Government Account named CBN/FGN
INDEPENDENT REVENUE account number 400-939134 with J.P.MORGAN CHASE
BANK,New York.You can do your independent verification of this. However,
by virtue of our  position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we
cannot acquire this funds in our name. This is because as top civil
servants, we are not allowed by law of the land to own or operate bank
accounts outside our country for now.

I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues,
to look for an overseas partner in whose account we would
transfer the fund

Hence the reason for this mail.We shall be Transferring the money to your
account with your company as we shall present your company as a registered
Foreign company in Nigeria and you are been paid for a contract which you
executed for our country through the NDDC and any other Federal Ministry
that we decide to use to siphon the funds through.

For your support and partnership,please reply me to negotiate your fees or
the percentage you wish to be paid when the funds arrive your bank account.

You must however note that this transaction, with
regards to our disposition to continue with you, is subject
to these terms. Firstly, our conviction of your transparency.
Secondly, that you treat this transaction with utmost secrecy
and confidentiality. Finally and above all, that you will provide
an account that you have absolute control over.

The transaction, although discrete, is legitimate and there
is no risk or legal disadvantages either to ourselves or yourself now or
in the future as we have put in place perfect mchineries that will ensure
a hitch free transfer into your account upon acceptance.

The transfer will be effected to your account within ten-fourteen
(10-14) working days as soon as we reach an agreement and you furnish
me with a  suitable bank account and company name and address with all

[ILUG] Do NOT Drop your Life Insurance,Wesley Gee <lhjr55@yahoo.com>,ilug@linux.ie,"Wed, 11 Sep 2002 06:12:39 -0500","Dear ilug@linux.ie 

Life Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. 
Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.

Why do people sell their policies? 
The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:

Pay off debts 
Fund long term care insurance cost 
Eliminate costly premiums 
Take advantage of other financial opportunities 
Make charitable contributions 
Help family members 
 
  
Life Partners �Living Solutions� 
  
Traditionally, life insurance provides benefits only after death. With Life Partners, it can provide cash benefits for LIFE! 
  
Life Partners Objectives 
Provide market appraisal for life insurance policy owners 
Provide bids for qualified policies 
Provide lump sum cash payments to qualified owners 
Eliminate costly premium payments  

Contact us now for a FREE appraisal of your life insurance policy.  REMEMBER THIS IS A FREE SERVICE AND THERE IS NO COST TO YOU !!

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 

Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you. 

NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.

 Gateway to Wealth
 As one of the industry's premier producers, you must continually seek
qualified cutting edge services.
 Financial Profiles	
 Concept	Profiles+ Professional is a personal and business
analysis tool that analyzes a client's insurance, investment and
financial planning goals, to help them see their situation today
compared to their objectives. 	
 Market	Profiles+ Professional is an ideal tool for true financial
planning. It not only provides a thorough analysis, including asset
allocation, but it can calculate tax implications in a client's plan.
Due to its modular format, it can be used for specific planning needs,
as well as more comprehensive planning. 	
 Benefits
This software not only provides exceptional analysis, but excels in
providing simple as well as comprehensive presentation pages. By
uncovering multiple needs, producers sell more products.	 
 Deferral+	
 Concept	An internet-based ""sales-enabling"" service, which allows
users to quickly become successful in the deferred compensation (COLI)
market. 	
 Market	Focus on mid-market businesses. In the area of executive
benefits, the mid-market opportunity should be defined by either the
number of employees within a company, or more specifically by the number
of highly compensated executives within a company.	 
 Benefits
A turnkey program that includes qualification of prospect, marketing and
sales support, case design, plan documents and administration. 	
 G.I.F.T.

funding mechanism for life products purchased to offset large estate and
corporate liabilities. 	
 Market	Clients with a high net worth of at least $10 million who have
an insurance need and believe their existing portfolio of investments,
when left unliquidated, will earn more then they will have to pay on
loan interest expenses.

illustrations and access to a consortium of established banks willing
and able to lend in this market. Loans are available in both U.S.

Looking for property in SPAIN?,Dont waste your Time!!!  Why? <wwc1@freeuk.com>,Iiu-list-request <iiu-list-request@zzzzason.org>,"Thu, 12 Sep 2002 13:24:51 +0200","
    
Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time! 
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!! 

The property market is moving very fast here in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present to you a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

Property finders Spain 
can do just that!

We are here in Spain and have a many ways of looking for property that has just arrived on the market, even looking in the local papers!

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><font class=""body""><font
 face=""Verdana, 





sans-serif""><font size=""2"">Sound crazy? Perhaps.  With 
advertising,<span lang=""en-US""> online </span>and off,  taking it on the chin
for the past two years,  online content sites have been shutting down,  laying
off staff and pulling back on their offerings.</font></font></font></p>
    
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><font class=""body""><font
 face=""Verdana, 





sans-serif""><font size=""2"">However,  this horrible environment
has resulted in an undeniable trend:  content businesses are challenging
people to pay for content.  Finally,  after five years of free,  people are<span
 lang=""en-US""> beginning </span>to understand that online,  as in the real
world,  you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards.
 U.S.  consumers spent $675 million&nbsp;on paid&nbsp;online content last
year,  a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels,  according to Online
Publishers Association,  and that figure is expected to increase exponentially
this year.  Look at these success stories:</font></font></font></p>

[ILUG] MICHAEL ! ilug,ilug <ilug@linux.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Mon, 16 Sep 2002 09:33:38 +0200"," ilug ,

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!
 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7

                  Welcome to ""Ghetto"" America!
�...Yes, you heard me; I said ""Ghetto"" America! What is ""Ghetto"" 
America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is 
no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals 
comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!
 
These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica,Aleksandar Gligoric <aleksandar.gilgoric@fiaz.co.yu>,List Member <ler@lerctr.org>,"Mon, 09 Sep 2002 10:11:56 -0000","
       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica,ContraComm International <istina007@yahoo.com>,List Member <ler@lerctr.org>,"Wed, 11 Sep 2002 08:33:28 -0000","
       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

One of a kind Money maker! Try it for free!,Ben Green <bengreen@mindupmerchants.com>,ler@lerctr.org,"Fri, 13 Sep 2002 20:38:55 -0700","<body lang=EN-US>

<div class=Section1>


<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of

Still looking for a house?,Synteligent Properties <Jeremy@synteligent.com>,ports@FreeBSD.ORG,"Sat, 14 Sep 2002 13:36:40 -0000","My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.

I need those houses...

Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) 

I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. 

If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com 

Best Wishes, 
Jeremy Lessaris

[ILUG] ASSISTANCE,"""COL. MICHAEL BUNDU"" <mikbundu@rediffmail.com>",ilug@linux.ie,"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 15:30:45 +0100","FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236
email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com
Dear Sir/Madam


SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 

Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 
dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange
and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence 
and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the
Democratic Republic of Congo and one of 
the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may 
his soul rest in peace. 

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in
my country, I and some of my colleagues were 
instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. We were then given this money privately 
by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other
Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 
was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 
said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 
(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military
Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President
Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 

In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country 
as the beneficiary. 
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
Cover to a security company in Europe in your 
name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked
''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from
our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
with the late President Kabila, immediately 
after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,
the information We gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks. The said money is a state fund and 
therefore requires a total confidentiality. 

We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in Europe. This is because we are under 
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.

Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's
Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required 
guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as
soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist 
us. 

I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
Thank you and God Bless. 
Best Regards 


COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com

N\B. When you are calling my line, you dial your country Intl. access

code i.e. (243). Just dial your country Intl. access code + 88216

Don't get caught by rising interest rates.,bralbertini21@netscape.net,crew_4@hotmail.com,"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 13:28:38 -0400","Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

[ILUG-Social] HELLO,Femi Daniel <femidan@mail.com>,social@linux.ie,"Wed, 18 Sep 2002 01:11:52 -0000","OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 

Yours faithfully,

Egnr. Femi Daniel.

NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

[ILUG] HELLO,Femi Daniel <femidan@mail.com>,ilug@linux.ie,"Wed, 18 Sep 2002 01:11:54 -0000","OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 

Yours faithfully,

Egnr. Femi Daniel.

NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

"Last time you spent $25 did u make $100,000,s? Well this time you will. wju","""hdwr.Rui Santos"" <jatoy73@bigpond.com>",Undisclosed.Recipients@webnote.net,"Thu, 19 Sep 2002 02:14:46 +1000","Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

Never pay eBay listing fees again!,calebn@msn.com,webmaster@efi.ie,"Thu, 19 Sep 2002 01:15:03 +1100","Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

** THE BULKBOOK
Teaches you step-by-step how to become a high profit

face=굴림><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt""> : 美 또는 건강에 대한 관심이 높아지면서
뷰티 관련 산업이 활황을 맞고 있다. 이에 피부관리사, 발관리사, 스포츠마사지를 비롯하여 네일아티스트,
메이크업아티스트, 헤어디자이너, 컬러디렉터를 양성하는 학원들도 많이 생겨나고 있는 추세. 美에 대한 관심은
여성뿐만 아니라 남성에게도 중요시 되고 있는 분야이며, 요즈음은 '꽃미남'이라 불리우는 피부가 곱고 예쁘장한
남자들이 인기가 높다. 따라서 피부관리사 자격증을 소지하고 있으면 피부과, 전문피부마사지센터 등 인력수급이 좋은
상태. <IMG height=10

Definitely the answer many have been waiting for!!,itshappening07@yahoo.co.uk,OPtinList <itshappening07@yahoo.co.uk>,"Thu, 19 Sep 2002 22:57:17 +0100","================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============

Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. 


The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!


Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.

Funds Investment,equitychambers williams falana <wequitychambers@caramail.com>,williams.falana@caramail.com,"Fri, 20 Sep 2002 12:15:37 -0000","SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 

Best regards, 
Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

has only one E-mail address...<BR>that's 500 million potential customers and

method of distributing<BR>information on the face of the earth.<BR><BR>Well, I 
think you get the picture.� The numbers and potential are <BR>just 
staggering, but it gets even better...<BR><BR>Suppose I told you that you could 
start your own E-mail business<BR>today and enjoy these

THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG . . .<BR>As you read on you'll discover how 
a 'Seen on National TV' <BR>program is paying out a half million dollars, every 
4 to 5 months<BR>from your home, for an investment of only $25 US Dollars

INTERNET!<BR><BR>Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following:<BR>This is 
the letter you have been hearing about on the news<BR>lately.� Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet,<BR>a national weekly news program 
recently devoted an entire<BR>show to the investigation of this program 
described below,<BR>to see if it really can make people money.<BR><BR>The show 
also investigated whether or not the program was<BR>legal.� Their findings 
proved once and for all that there are<BR>""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the 
participation in the<BR>program and if people can follow the simple 
instructions,<BR>they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out 
of<BR>pocket cost"".<BR><BR>���� DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE

you can save them on your<BR>computer and resell them.<BR><BR>YOUR TOTAL COST $5 
X 5 = $25.00<BR><BR>**********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail,

work this way.� Believe us, we have tried to be greedy<BR>and then nothing 
happened.<BR><BR>So do not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed.<BR>Because if you do, it will not work for you.� 
Remember,<BR>honesty reaps the reward!!!<BR><BR>1. After you have ordered all 5 
reports, take this <BR>advertisement and REMOVE the name and address of the 
person in<BR>REPORT # 5.� This person has made it through the cycle and is 
<BR>no doubt counting their fortune.<BR><BR>2. Move the name & address in 
REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.<BR>3. Move the name & address in REPORT #3 down 
to REPORT #4.<BR>4. Move the name & address in REPORT #2 down to REPORT 
#3.<BR>5. Move the name & address in REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.<BR>6.

SURE you copy every name & 
address<BR>ACCURATELY!<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Take 
this entire letter, with the modified list of names,<BR>and save it on your 
computer.� DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER<BR>CHANGES.� Save this on a disk as 
well just in case you loose<BR>any data.<BR><BR>To assist you with marketing 
your business on the Internet,<BR>the 5 reports you purchase will provide you 
with invaluable<BR>marketing information that includes:� How to send bulk 
e-mails<BR>legally, Where to find thousand of free classified ads and <BR>much, 
much more.<BR><BR>There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture 
going:<BR><BR>�� METHOD #1:� SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY<BR>�� 
---------------------------------------------------------<BR>Let's say that you 
decide to start small, just to see how<BR>it goes, and we'll assume you and 
those involved send out<BR>only 5,000 emails each.� Let's also assume that 
the mailing<BR>receives only a 0.2% response (the response could be 
much<BR>better but lets just say it is only 0.2%.� Also, many 
people<BR>will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of<BR>only 
5,000 each).<BR><BR>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 
e-mails.<BR>With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for Report #1.<BR>Those 
10 people resonded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each<BR>for a total of 
50,000.� Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%<BR>responded with 
orders.� That's 100 people responded and<BR>ordered Report #2.� Those 
100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails<BR>each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.� 
The 0.2% response to <BR>that is 1000 orders for Report #3.<BR><BR>Thoe 1000 
people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of<BR>5 million e-mails sent 
out.� The 0.2% response to that is<BR>10,000 orders for Report #4.� 
Those 10,000 people send out<BR>5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 
million)<BR>e-mails.� the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for<BR>Report #5.<BR><BR>THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = 500,000<BR>(a 
half a million).<BR><BR>���� Your total income in this 
example is:<BR>���� 1......$50 +<BR>���� 
2......$500 +<BR>���� 3......$5,000 
+<BR>���� 4......$50,000 +<BR>���� 
5......$500,000 .................. Grand Total = 
$555,550.00<BR><BR>���� NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.� GET A 
PENCIL & PAPER AND<BR>���� FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE 
RESPONSES AND <BR>���� NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU 
WILL<BR>���� STILL MAKE A LOT OF 
MONEY!<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>���� 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10<BR>���� PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.<BR><BR>Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone,<BR>or 1/2, or even 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails<BR>each or more?� There are over 250 million people on the 
<BR>Internet worldwide and counting.� Believe me, many people<BR>will do 
just that, and more!<BR><BR>���� METHOD #2:� PLACING 
FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<BR>��� 
<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Advertising 
on the net is very, very inexpensive and there<BR>are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise.� Placing a lot of<BR>free ads on the internet will easily get a 
larger response.<BR>We strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add 
METHOD<BR># 2 as you go along.<BR><BR>For every $5 you receive, all you must do 
is e-mail them the <BR>Report they ordered.� That's it!� Always 
provide same day<BR>service on all orders.� This will guarantee that the 
e-mails<BR>they send out, with your name and address on it, will be<BR>prompt 
because they can not advertise until they receive 
the<BR>report.<BR><BR>���� ORDER EACH REPORT BY IT NUMBER 
& NAME ONLY.<BR><BR>Note:� Always send $5 cash (US Currency) for each 
report.<BR>Checks are NOT accepted.� Make sure the cash is wrapped in<BR>at 
lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope.<BR>On one of those 
sheets of paper, write the NUMBER and the NAME<BR>of the Report you are 
ordering, your email ADDRESS, your NAME<BR>and postal address.� Make sure 
you affix the proper 'International'<BR>Postage if ordering a report from 
outside your country.<BR><BR>���� PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

Funds Investment,equitychambers williams falana <wequitychambers@caramail.com>,williams.falana@caramail.com,"Fri, 20 Sep 2002 12:28:59 -0000","SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 

Best regards, 
Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

Friend,<BR><BR>A recent survey by Nielsen/Netratings says that ""The Internet

DOES ALL THIS MEAN TO YOU? EASY MONEY!!<BR><BR>Let's assume that every person 
has only one E-mail address...<BR>that's 500 million potential customers and 
growing!� In addition,<BR>E'mail is without question the most powerful 
method of distributing<BR>information on the face of the earth.<BR><BR>Well, I 
think you get the picture.� The numbers and potential are <BR>just 
staggering, but it gets even better...<BR><BR>Suppose I told you that you could 
start your own E-mail business<BR>today and enjoy these 
benefits:<BR><BR>���� *** All Customers Pay You In 
Cash!!!<BR>���� *** You Will Sell A Product Which Costs 
Nothing to Produce!<BR>���� *** Your Only Overhead Is Your 
Time!<BR>���� *** You Have 100s Of Millions Of Potential 
Customers!!!<BR>���� *** You Get Detailed, Easy To Follow 
Startup 
Instructions!<BR><BR>��������� AND 
THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG . . .<BR>As you read on you'll discover how 
a 'Seen on National TV' <BR>program is paying out a half million dollars, every 
4 to 5 months<BR>from your home, for an investment of only $25 US Dollars 
expense,<BR>one time.� ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE . . . <BR>AND THE 
INTERNET!<BR><BR>Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following:<BR>This is 
the letter you have been hearing about on the news<BR>lately.� Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet,<BR>a national weekly news program 
recently devoted an entire<BR>show to the investigation of this program 
described below,<BR>to see if it really can make people money.<BR><BR>The show 
also investigated whether or not the program was<BR>legal.� Their findings 
proved once and for all that there are<BR>""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the 
participation in the<BR>program and if people can follow the simple 
instructions,<BR>they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out 
of<BR>pocket cost"".<BR><BR>���� DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE 
OF POPULARITY<BR>���� AND RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED,<BR>���� IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN 
EVER!<BR><BR>***** This is what one had to say:<BR><BR>""Thanks to this 
profitable opportunity.� I was approached many<BR>times before but each 
time I passed on it.� I am so glad I<BR>finally joined just to see what one 
could expect in return<BR>for the minimal effort and money required.� To my

is another testimonial:<BR><BR>""This program has been around for a long time but 
I never<BR>believed in it.� But one day when I received this again in 
<BR>the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.� I followed the<BR>simple 
instructions and walaa. . . .� 3 weeks later the money<BR>started to come 
in.� First month I only made $240.00 but the<BR>next 2 months after that I 
made a total of $290,000.00.<BR>So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I <BR>have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again.<BR><BR>The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple<BR>steps and NOT change 
anything.""<BR><BR>More testimonials later but first:<BR><BR>** PRINT THIS NOW

report.<BR><BR>���� MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
YOUR<BR>���� ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any 
mail<BR>���� problems.<BR><BR>���� 
*****When you place your order, make 
sure<BR>�������������� 
you order each of the 5 reports *****<BR><BR>You will need all 5 reports so that 
you can save them on your<BR>computer and resell them.<BR><BR>YOUR TOTAL COST $5 
X 5 = $25.00<BR><BR>**********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, 
each<BR>of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.� Save<BR>them 
on your computer so they will be accessible for you to<BR>send to the 1,000's of 
people who will order them from you.<BR>Also make a floppy of these reports and 
keep it at your desk<BR>in case something happens to your 
computer.<BR><BR>**********IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the 
people<BR>who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the <BR>list, 
in any way other than what is intructed below in steps<BR>1 through 6 or you 
will lose out on the majority of your profits.<BR>Once you understand the way 
this works, you will also see how<BR>it does not work if you change 
it.<BR><BR>Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,<BR>it will 
NOT work!!!<BR><BR>People have tried to put their friends/relatives names 
on<BR>all five thinking they could get all the money.� But it does<BR>not 
work this way.� Believe us, we have tried to be greedy<BR>and then nothing 
happened.<BR><BR>So do not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed.<BR>Because if you do, it will not work for you.� 
Remember,<BR>honesty reaps the reward!!!<BR><BR>1. After you have ordered all 5 
reports, take this <BR>advertisement and REMOVE the name and address of the 
person in<BR>REPORT # 5.� This person has made it through the cycle and is 
<BR>no doubt counting their fortune.<BR><BR>2. Move the name & address in 
REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.<BR>3. Move the name & address in REPORT #3 down 
to REPORT #4.<BR>4. Move the name & address in REPORT #2 down to REPORT 
#3.<BR>5. Move the name & address in REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.<BR>6. 
Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT #1 Position.<BR><BR>PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & 
address<BR>ACCURATELY!<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Take 
this entire letter, with the modified list of names,<BR>and save it on your 
computer.� DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER<BR>CHANGES.� Save this on a disk as 
well just in case you loose<BR>any data.<BR><BR>To assist you with marketing 
your business on the Internet,<BR>the 5 reports you purchase will provide you 
with invaluable<BR>marketing information that includes:� How to send bulk 
e-mails<BR>legally, Where to find thousand of free classified ads and <BR>much, 
much more.<BR><BR>There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture 
going:<BR><BR>�� METHOD #1:� SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY<BR>�� 
---------------------------------------------------------<BR>Let's say that you 
decide to start small, just to see how<BR>it goes, and we'll assume you and 
those involved send out<BR>only 5,000 emails each.� Let's also assume that 
the mailing<BR>receives only a 0.2% response (the response could be 
much<BR>better but lets just say it is only 0.2%.� Also, many 
people<BR>will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of<BR>only 
5,000 each).<BR><BR>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 
e-mails.<BR>With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for Report #1.<BR>Those 
10 people resonded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each<BR>for a total of 
50,000.� Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%<BR>responded with 
orders.� That's 100 people responded and<BR>ordered Report #2.� Those 
100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails<BR>each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.� 
The 0.2% response to <BR>that is 1000 orders for Report #3.<BR><BR>Thoe 1000 
people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of<BR>5 million e-mails sent 
out.� The 0.2% response to that is<BR>10,000 orders for Report #4.� 
Those 10,000 people send out<BR>5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 
million)<BR>e-mails.� the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for<BR>Report #5.<BR><BR>THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = 500,000<BR>(a 
half a million).<BR><BR>���� Your total income in this 
example is:<BR>���� 1......$50 +<BR>���� 
2......$500 +<BR>���� 3......$5,000 
+<BR>���� 4......$50,000 +<BR>���� 
5......$500,000 .................. Grand Total = 
$555,550.00<BR><BR>���� NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.� GET A 
PENCIL & PAPER AND<BR>���� FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE 
RESPONSES AND <BR>���� NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU 
WILL<BR>���� STILL MAKE A LOT OF 
MONEY!<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>���� 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10<BR>���� PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.<BR><BR>Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone,<BR>or 1/2, or even 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails<BR>each or more?� There are over 250 million people on the 
<BR>Internet worldwide and counting.� Believe me, many people<BR>will do 
just that, and more!<BR><BR>���� METHOD #2:� PLACING 
FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<BR>��� 
<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Advertising 
on the net is very, very inexpensive and there<BR>are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise.� Placing a lot of<BR>free ads on the internet will easily get a 
larger response.<BR>We strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add 
METHOD<BR># 2 as you go along.<BR><BR>For every $5 you receive, all you must do 
is e-mail them the <BR>Report they ordered.� That's it!� Always 
provide same day<BR>service on all orders.� This will guarantee that the 
e-mails<BR>they send out, with your name and address on it, will be<BR>prompt 
because they can not advertise until they receive 
the<BR>report.<BR><BR>���� ORDER EACH REPORT BY IT NUMBER 
& NAME ONLY.<BR><BR>Note:� Always send $5 cash (US Currency) for each 
report.<BR>Checks are NOT accepted.� Make sure the cash is wrapped in<BR>at 
lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope.<BR>On one of those 
sheets of paper, write the NUMBER and the NAME<BR>of the Report you are 
ordering, your email ADDRESS, your NAME<BR>and postal address.� Make sure 
you affix the proper 'International'<BR>Postage if ordering a report from 
outside your country.<BR><BR>���� PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

Jody about receiving ""junk mail"".� I made fun of the<BR>whole thing, 
spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved.� I 
""knew"" it wouldn't work.� Jody<BR>totally ignored my supposed intelligence 
and a few days later<BR>she jumped in with both feet.� I made merciless fun 
of her,<BR>and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her when<BR>the thing 
didn't work.� Well, the laugh was on me!� Within<BR>3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses.� Within the next 45<BR>days she had received a total 
of $147,200.00 all cash!<BR>I was shocked.� I have joined Jody in her

being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>make up my mind to 
participate in this plan.� But conservative<BR>that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little<BR>that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders<BR>to at least get my money back.� I was 
surprised when I found<BR>my medium sized post office box crammed with 
orders.� I made<BR>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.� The nice thing 
about this<BR>deal is that it does not matter where people live.� 
There<BR>simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and<BR>so 
big"".<BR><BR>���� Dan Sondstrom,� Alberta, 
Canada<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>""I 
had received this program before.� I deleted it, but later<BR>I wondered if 
I should hav given it a try.� Of course, I<BR>had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to<BR>wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else 
. . . . . . . <BR>11 months passed then it luckily came again.� I did not 
<BR>delete this one!� I made more than $490,000 on my first try<BR>and all 
the money came within 22 weeks"".<BR><BR>���� Susan De

A great product line will not make you money either.
A great compensation plan will not make you money either.
A great company will not make you money either.

Some say it's a combination of the above.
Some say it's what's inside you that matters the most.

Forget about meetings, one-on-one, 3-ways calls, etc.
Those old ways of network marketing has come and gone.
They wear you out long before you make any money.

What makes you money is a downline associated with a
stable company that has consumable products.

Where's the downline coming from?  Well, we have an
online automatic recruiting system that does the work
for you.  Our system will place paying members in 
your downline.

Furthermore, you can see it working first hand before
you decide what to do, if any.

Dear sir/madam

With good recommendation,I  decided to contact you.
I am PRINCE DAVID  SAVIMBI, the son of JONAS SAVIMBI ,the leader of the
UNITA rebel in ANGOLA, who  was killed in february by the troop loyal to
the government .After his funeral  and burial,we had a family meeting and
resolved to invest the money he left  behind in your country, hence this
letter to you.He left the sum of $80 million  us dollars in cash, which was
a proceed from the sale of diamonds,which was  under his control.

However,the entire  development made us to flee ANGOLA to JOHANESBURG,SOUTH
AFRICA, for fear of  being killed.
The amount of $80 million  united states dollars in cash is presently in our
possession, and I would want it  to be invested in your country,due to the
stability of your economy.The money is  presently with an emergency
diplomatic security courier company,which my mother and I hurriedly used to move the
cargo out from our country to SOUTH AFRICA.We  registered it under a security
code with no name, and was registered as  containing photographic paper
material.

My mother and I have resolved to give you  15% of the total sum for your assistance in
getting this funds transferred to  your reliable company's account in your
country,for investment.We have equally  resolved to spend the rest of our
lives in your country.You have to  make traveling arrangement
of coming to JOHANESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA,immediately to  meet with me face to
face and see the funds physically,then have it transferred  to your
account.Afterwhich both of us would travel together to your country for
sharing and immediate investment,then my family will join me later.

As we await your urgent  reply, strictly through my e-mail davsav@maktoob.com or
 davidsavimbi@maktoob.com  or my private phone number +882 1 646685229.  your
absolute trust and confidentiality is highly solicited to serve us better.

Best regard
PRINCE DAVID SAVIMBI    ",1

school? She was 46 and you were 15? Remember the time
when she bent over to do her gardening and you saw her
sagging breasts through the v-neck opening of her summer

Too Busy Earning A Living To Make Any Money,donna22000r47@loveable.com,zzzz@spamassassin.taint.org,"Sat, 23 Sep 0102 02:41:39 -0900","Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?





If you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minute presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  

Plus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.

Many are called, few are chosen.   Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  

                          ***  801-294-3480  *** 

Please do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.  Looking forward to your call.    

                          ***  801-294-3480  ***

[ILUG] Earn 100.000$ in one year working at home,"""Robert@home-based-business.de"" <Robert@home-based-business.de>",ilug@linux.ie,"Sun, 22 Sep 2002 22:02:32 +0200","Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

______________________________________________________
$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

You can gain from lowest interest rates in 30 years,renato51927@netscape.net,kimk@sprint.ca,"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 00:59:34 -0400","Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

Your eBay account is about to expire!,robertm@att.net,webmaster@efi.ie,"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 05:29:50 +0500","Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a

Dont waste your TIME!!! Why?,Looking for property in SPAIN? <wwc1@freeuk.com>,Iiu-list-request <iiu-list-request@zzzzason.org>,"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 21:16:49 +0200","
    
Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time!
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!!

The property market is moving very fast in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present you with a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

 Property finders Spain 
can do just that!

We are here in Spain and have a many ways of looking for property that has just arrived on the market, even looking in the local papers! 

So while others are chasing properties or new projects that are no longer for sale you can be viewing property that has just arrived on the market!

Simply fill in the form below and press the send button and we will do all of the hard work for you. 

Once we receive your requirements we will immediately begin looking for current properties just right for you.

      additional processing materials will continue to<br>
      arrive at your home, dorm or apartment for as long<br>
      as you wish to participate!<br>
      <br>
      </font><font size=""2""><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">Honestly, there is NO
      GUESSWORK.&nbsp; Our program<br>
      has </font><font face=""Arial"">been around for several years and is very<br>
      successful!<br>
      <b><br>
      <font color=""#0000FF""><i>FACT</i></font><br>
      </b>Even working slowly, you could still earn a MUCH<br>
      BETTER weekly income than most regular 9:00 AM to<br>
      5:00 PM jobs!<br>
      THERE IS NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED<br>
      TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROGRAM<br>
      Anyone, young or old, male or female, anywhere in<br>
      the United States can easily earn great money<br>
      participating in our Pamphlet Processing Program!<br>
      The reason why our program does not require any<br>
      experience is simple... it does not take any previous<br>
      experience to fold a pamphlet, insert it into an envelope,<br>
      and seal an envelope. Plus, our program is especially<br>
      beneficial for people who need to earn a serious<br>
      extra income but might not have the spare time for<br>
      a second job.<br>
      As stated, just a few hours per day could possibly<br>
      earn you well over $500.00 per week... NO JOKE!<br>
      Just imagine how nice it would be if you could<br>
      earn an extra $500.00 to $1,500.00 per week<br>
      working from your home...no more annoying<br>
      boss...no more hectic rush hour commuting...no<br>
      more stressful 9 to 5 job, and no more headaches !<br>
      <br>
      <b><i><font color=""#0000FF"">FACT</font></i><br>
      </b>Practically every type of person can benefit<br>
      financially from our Pamphlet Processing Program.<br>

      Manual is 100% Legal and Legitimate! In fact,<br>
      there are hundreds of lawyers and attorneys all<br>
      over the country using this valuable information<br>
      and charging people big money to remove negative<br>
      and incorrect items from their credit files!<br>
      However, our Credit Repair Manual explains how<br>
      people can do the VERY SAME THING that these<br>
      costly attorneys are doing except our credit<br>
      repair manual shows people how to repair their<br>
      credit FAST, EASY and for FREE without having to<br>
      hire an attorney !<br>
      <br>
      Now is the time, there are TENS-OF-MILLIONS of<br>
      Americans with bad credit that would probably love<br>
      to receive our Credit Repair Manual !<br>
      Therefore, if you are serious about devoting a<br>
      few hours per week towards the opportunity of<br>
      earning an honest extra income, our $1.00 Pamphlet<br>
      Processing Program is PERFECT FOR YOU!<br>

      <br>
      This manual is included for becoming a<br>
      member of our Pamphlet Processing Program !<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, to get started immediately, all that<br>
      our company requires is a one-time refundable<br>
      order-processing fee of only $45.<br>
      Please understand, we cannot afford to<br>
      send out a package of valuable materials to<br>
      everyone interested in our program. And also keep<br>
      in mind that once you process 100 pamphlets you<br>
      will have already earned your $45 back and are<br>
      left with an extra $55 profit !!!<br>
      <br>
      We must charge a small processing fee to<br>
      ensure that only serious individuals intend to<br>
      participate in our program.&nbsp; Keep in mind, you<br>
      NEVER have to pay us any other fees and you can<br>
      participate for as long as you wish! This fee<br>
      simply assures our company that you are indeed<br>
      serious about our program and the opportunity to<br>
      make good money working from your home. Sorry, we<br>
      CAN NOT process your order form without the<br>
      one-time processing fee since there are far<br>
      too many serious individuals willing to pay this<br>
      small one-time fee in order to participate in our<br>
      high profit work-at-home program. Therefore, all<br>
      you have to do is just complete, print, sign, and<br>
      send in the Order Form (FORM AGM-222: 16.F).<br>
      <br>
      Please, be sure to complete the Order Form IN<br>
      FULL, legible, with your correct shipping address<br>
      in order to prevent any processing delays in<br>
      the shipment of your package. That's right, if you<br>
      are really looking for a 100% LEGAL and LEGITIMATE<br>
      home based income opportunity we can honestly say<br>
      that you have finally found the right company with<br>

[ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount.,Hugh5546x73@bigfoot.com,ilug@linux.ie,"Tue, 24 Sep 2002 01:31:44 +1200","Hi -

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 informtion

""Send me a free membership!""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with
""Remove"" in the subject line.  By submitting a request for a FREE
DHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for
both their consumer and business opportunities.

[ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount.,Hugh6626t76@bigfoot.com,ilug@linux.ie,"Wed, 25 Sep 2002 09:45:21 -0400","Hi -

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 information

""Send me a free membership!""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP(URGENT/CONFIDENTIAL),"""MR.VINCENT NNAJI."" <vinnet@mail.com>",zzzz@spamassassin.taint.org,"Thu, 26 Sep 2002 04:22:43 +0200","Mr.Vincent Nnaji,
 Standard Trust Bank Ltd,
 Lagos,Nigeria.
 Dear Sir,
 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 
Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 
Thanks and Regards,
 MR.VINCENT NNAJI.

Partnership.,"""Mrs. Anne Kojo"" <annekojo@email.com>",zzzz-iiu@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 25 Sep 2002 16:46:33 -0700","Dear Sir, 
With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions. 
Note: There is no risk involved in this business. 
Remain Blessed, 
MRS. ANNE  KOJO

[ILUG] WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE TO INVEST IN YOUR COUNTRY,VICTOR SANKOH <victorsankoh@mail.com>,ilug@linux.ie,"Fri, 13 Jul 2001 10:53:02 +0200","Dear Sir/Madam,

I am well confident of your capability to assist me in
a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish with you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.

Well, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY
SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars).

This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond
by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.

Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of C�te d'Ivoire.

Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from C�te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount at the end of this business. The security
of this business is very important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply.
Thank you and God bless you.

VICTOR SANKOH

Faeries,About Time <evtwqmigru@datcon.co.uk>,wciml@chez.com,"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 23:01:36 -1900","UNCOMMON EXOTIC PLEASURE BOTANICALS!

Feeling marvelous, Mood-Sensitive, Mood-Enhancing, Depressive/Regressive, ""Sweet Treat"" forumulations for the Pleasuring and Well-Being of Body, Mind & Spirit from the planet's foremost ""Sensitive"" ethnobotanical cooperative -- Exotic Botanical Resources! (Product descriptions, pricing and deep-discounted Intro Offers information below.)

SEVENTH HEAVEN ""SWEET TREAT"" MENU 

1. SHANGRILA ZOWIE WOWIE (tm) (Gnarly Sweet Grass).  Absolutely, the most significant legal ""Personal Choice"" non-cannabis, non-marijuana, non-tobacco smoking botanical on the planet.

2. PROSAKA (tm) High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.

3. AQUEOUS KATHMANDU (tm) (Happy Drops) ""Personal Choice"" enhanced ""Sensitivity"" for non-smokers & tokers.

4. SWEET VJESTIKA (tm) (Aphrodisia Drops) Erotica; Intimacy ""Sensitivity"" Enhancement at its finest for men & woman.

5. GENTLE FEROCITY (tm) Viripotent Energization, Appetite Suppression Tablets without the inclusion of  Caffeine or MaHaung Herb or Ephedrine!

6. CAPILLARIS HERBA (tm) A sedate smoking and/or brewing Happiness  Botanical. 

********************************
**Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)**
********************************

""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba.

Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)

This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!

We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.

Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
* ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!
* 4 – 5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.
* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)
* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!
* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.
* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No ""munchie"" factor.
* No failed drug tests!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time....

******************
**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************

High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.

This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.

Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. 

Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) 

Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.

********************************************************
PROSAKA PRICING:

* One 100 count bag ... $55.00 plus shipping
* One 300 count container ... $130.00 plus shipping
For larger quantities, please inquire.

**AQUEOUS KATHMANDU (tm) (Happy Drops)**
*******************************************

""Personal Choice"" enhanced ""Sensitivity"" for non-smokers & tokers.

Aqueous Kathmandu has only been offered to market at large for a short while. However, in a short time this product has achieved a tremendous, very happy following.

Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Happiness Drops(Temple ""Quantum"" Variety). Indeed; a Happiness Brew from the Kathmandu a.k.a. ""Secret Fire"" from a toke-smoke point of view, if you know what I mean and be groovin' the scene. Who du the Kathmandu? Now, everybody can du the Kathmandu!  (that is, if you're 21 years of age or older) Aqueous Kathmandu is engaged to holistically inspire and instill ""sensitive/responsive"" happiness and mellowness without the detriment of carcinogenic inhalation (smoking). Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled, considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors!

**CAPILLARIS HERBA (tm)**
***************************

A Sedate Smoking or Brewing Happiness Botanical.

Capillaris Loose-leaf Herba is a very calming, happy sort of smoking/brewing herba. Capillaris Herba is a singular botanical and is best utilized close to bedtime as it is a very sedate herba. Not as potent as Shangrila Zowie Wowie from a smoking perspective (no legal product is), but well worth your attention! Many folks find that if they partake of both smoke and brew that not only do they go to sleep very happily, but that their dreaming life is often nicely enhanced.

Capillaris Herba botanical is best rolled or bowled when engaged as a ""Smoka."" As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage Capillaris Herba as a most peaceful brew/tea. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Capillaris Herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) 

Capillaris Herba is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Capillaris Herba is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Capillaris Herba not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time.

Talkington purchased a Tax Lien on a 5 acre parcel for
$300. The owner failed to pay the taxes and forfeited
the 5-acre parcel to Craig Talkington. A short time
later Craig sold that property to one of the neighbors
for $20,000. That's the kind of money that buys new
cars and sends young people to college. Craig didn't
stop at one deal. He later bought a tax lien for only
$17 on a ten acre track, the property owner failed to
pay the taxes, and Craig ended up the property, which
he sold for $4,000. I don't know how much money you
are making right now but these are the kinds of
profits that change peoples lives and solve financial
problems and make things a lot better.

                                                             STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

I am pleased to introduce myself  to you.My name is Mr. Manuel Oko a native of South Africa and a senior employee of mines and natural resources department currently on a trainning course in Holland for few months.

I  am writing this letter to request your assistance in order to redeem an investment with the South African mining Corporation.The said investment, now valued at  ($15.5 million dollars ) Fifteen  million,five hundred thousand dollars only was purchased by Lucio Harper and contracted out to the South  African Mining Corporation in 1977 now recognised as mines and natural resources department.This redeemable investment interest,has now matured since March last year.

Since MARCH last year, several attempts have been made to contact Lucio Harper without success and there is no way to contact any of his close relatives in whose favour the investment cash value can be paid.                                                    
                                   
Since we have access to all Lucio Harper's information,we can claim this money with the help of my partners with the South African Mines and natural resources department.All we have to do is to file claim using you as Lucio Harper's relative.

I will like to assure you that there is absolutely nothing to worry about,because it is perfectly safe with no risk involved.Please ensure to keep this matter strictly confidential.My partner will file a claim for this money on your behalf from the SouthAfrican mining Corporation.When the claim is approved,you as the beneficiary 
will be paid (25%) of the total amouth.

Since this money can be paid directly into any bank account of your choice,you have responsibility to ensure that my partner and Ireceive(70%)of the total amouth.While the balance (5%) will be set aside for any unforseen expenses in the cause of transfering this money.

I will appreciate if you can give your assurance and guarantee that our share will be well secured.Please for the sake of confidentiality,reach me on my e-mail address:  manueloko1000@netscape.net .  Please let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you. Kindly reach me immediately with any of the stated contact addresses so that better clearifications 
relating to the transaction will be explained to you.


Truly yours

Manuel Oko

[ILUG] please kindly get back to me,"""DESMOND STEVENS."" <desmondstevens@name.com>",ilug@linux.ie,"Tue, 03 Dec 2002 13:38:05 +0100","






FROM:MR. DESMOND STEVENS

                     URGENT ASSISTANCE. 
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY. I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. 
BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHER�S MONEY TO 
 A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. 
AS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE
  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WHICHEVER OPTION YOU CHOOSE, FEEL FREE TO NOTIFY ME. I HAVE MAPPED OUT 5% OF THIS MONEY FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCESSING THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU DO NOT PREFER A PARTNERSHIP, I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU 25% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 70% THAT IS MEANT FOR ME, WILL BE FOR THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY. 
PLEASE, CONTACT ME WITH THE ABOVE TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL ADDRESS, WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION. 
YOURS FAITHFULLY, 
DESMOND STEVENS.

                  <p> Do you sell on eBay? If so, you could be making up
to $100,000 per month.<br>
                  <br>
                  This is no hype and no scam. Receiving over 1.5 billion page views per
month, eBay is the ULTIMATE venue for selling virtually anything and making
huge profits with almost no effort. But you have to know what to sell and
how to sell. That's where I come in.<br>
                  <br>
                  As a leading expert in internet marketing and the owner of several profitable
auction-based businesses, the manual that I have written provides easy to
understand and detailed instructions for maximizing your profits with selling
strategies that are PROVEN WINNERS.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you've read any other books on eBay, you know that all of them are designed
for the computer idiot and the auction novice. They tell you how to register,
how to list an item, how to avoid fraud, etc. This is not the information
you need to make millions on eBay. You need to learn effective SELLING STRATEGIES
not read a photocopy of eBay help files! My manual assumes that you already
know your way around eBay; you don't need any specialized computer knowledge,
but you should be familiar with buying and selling on eBay auctions. I'm
not going to waste your time teaching you how to register - I'm going to
pass on the SECRET SELLING TECHNIQUES that I use each and every day to bring
in hundreds of thousands of dollars selling my products on internet auctions.
The manual comes as a complete course with the following lessons:</p>
                  <p></p>

of thousands of dollars on eBay. Contained in the manual are WINNING STRATEGIES

REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.,kolaowo@netscape.net,kolaowo@netscape.net,"Fri, 23 Aug 2002 14:53:09 -0400","OWOLABI & ASSOCIATE,
FALOMO, IKOYI.
LAGOS - NIGERIA.


YOUR KIND ATTN.,



RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I
represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo’s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. What
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. But before the purchase could take
place the president died. My client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand
United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.

I remain most obliged.

Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).
Principal Partner. Owolabi & Associates

Immediate Reply Needed,"""Dr.James Ologun"" <jamesalabi@mail.com>",zzzz-sa-listinfo@jmason.org,"Sat, 24 Aug 2002 20:18:02 -0700","Dear Sir,

I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract
award and review committee set up by the federal
government of Nigeria under the new civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge
sum of money to a foreign account. 

There were series of contracts executed by a 
consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in
favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these 
contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum
of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand 
United
State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and
is now ready to be transferred being that the
companies
that actually executed these contracts have been
fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. 


Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to 
transfer the total amount to your account for
subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants
are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil
service law) from operating and/or opening foreign 
accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in 
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 
transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for
incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will
be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts
in due course. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds
within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of
the above stated terms. 
Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To 

accord this transaction the legality it deserves and
for mutual security of the funds the whole approval
procedures will officially and legally processed
with your name or the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. 
Once more I want you to understand that having put
in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my
country, I am averse to having my image and career 
dented. This matter should therefore be treated with
utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. 

Please you should signify your intention to assist
by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this
transaction, if favorable we will take further steps
to brief you the full details of this viable 
transaction. 
I want to assure you that this business proposal is
100% risk free as we have done our homework
properly. 

I quite believe that you will protect our interest
by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are
still in government service, which we intend to
retire from in full honor.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the next batch
which would constitute the new quarter payments
for the 2002 financial year. 

Thank you and God bless.

Dr James Alabi

ADV: Internet marketing & communications; earn $100k/year... uleio,bwiTim Fai <dwftan@earthlink.com>,Friend@webnote.net,"Sun, 25 Aug 2002 09:36:45 +0800","HELLO...By reading the short Summary just below, you
will see how you can learn new skills in communication,
do a direct marketing program on the internet, and at the
same time, earn $100,000 or more to enable you to
CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!

************SUMMARY***************************

Just read this Summary, follow the actions that it advises,
and start earning some serious money.  You will learn new
skills in communications and how to market on the internet.
What a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.

Step 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message,
and you have not joined in this program before, then
take out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mail
out $10.00 each to the following people to purchase five
Guides on communications.  For each Guide that you will
be ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain white
paper, your own name, address, and YOUR OWN EMAIL
ADDRESS, and the number and name of the Guide that
you are buying.  Then fold the paper, put the $10.00 bill
inside the sheet of paper, insert the paper and $10.00 bill
into an envelope, address the envelope with the name and
address of the person whose name is shown under each
Guide below, and mail the envelope by first class or air
mail. Be sure to put enough postage stamps on the
envelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.

________________________________________________
END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************

Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.

Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.

Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.

Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.

Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.

Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.

Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.

This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.

Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************

=======REST OF MESSAGE======================

With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!

READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.

= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =

If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.

===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================

Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.

Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.

Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.

Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.

If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)

If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795

If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.

There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.

METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.

The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.

===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.

PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.

=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!
===========================================
A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom to really change your life, but I don't
wish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You
can make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.

Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you
have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved
others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the
people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more
emails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember, the more you send out the more potential
buyers you will reach.

IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND
EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!

Upon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the
Copyright owner assigns to you two important rights:
(1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the
GUIDE that you have purchased, and (2) the right to assign
to your buyer of the GUIDE, the further right for your buyer
to resell that GUIDE.  Included in your purchase of Guide #1
is a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It's
free of charge and will give you the tools you need.

The right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES
is reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to
resell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the
internet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution.
YOU MAY NOT PRINT OUT THE GUIDES TO SELL OR
DISTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY.  You may print a copy of the
Guides for your own personal use to enhance your
communication skills.

Best news yet,patricehari@yahoo.ca,Vestedge.Update@dogma.slashnull.org,"Tue, 27 Aug 2002 05:19:21 -0100","INVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. 

Research Alert - Undervalued
August 26, 2002
XrayMedia
(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8

Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! 

Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.

Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... 

Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!

How does the company do this? 

XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. 

Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.

While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.

 *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.

*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. 

*** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.

*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.

*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. 

*** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

                 Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?





If you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minutes presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  

Plus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.

Many are called, few are chosen.  This opportunity will be limited to one qualified individual per state.  Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  

                          *** 801-397-9010 *** 

Please do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.  Looking forward to your call.    

                            *** 801-397-9010 ***

[ILUG] IMPORTANT.,DR SAMUEL EBOKA <SAMUELEBOKA11@YAHOO.COM>,ilug@linux.ie,"Wed, 28 Aug 2002 11:57:10 -1200","

email : samueleboka2@email.com
Lagos, Nigeria.
Dear Sir,

IMPORTANT.

After due deliberation with my colleagues, We have decided to forward to
you this business proposal. We want a reliable 
person who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ( 
$20,500,000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World
Countries.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us
under the budget allocation to our Ministry. This 
bill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The
contract has since been executed, 
commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.
We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part 
of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for
our own use. But under our protocol division, we 
as civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This
is why we are soliciting your assistance in this 
manner and regard .

As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address
from adverts in the business directory . I am the 
Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and
TROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. 
Officials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this
Ministry. We have been exercising patience for this 
opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity
we cannot afford to miss.

We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us and I and one of my colleagues 
involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,
upon the confirmation from you that the Certified 
International Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.

Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your
interest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel 
No: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct, DO NOT add my country(234) and
City(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert 
Telephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax
you or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS 
TRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get
through.
NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please
inform us so that we can look for another reliable 
person who can assist in this respect. 

It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this
transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be 
discovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual
trust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this 
transaction. Be further informed that everyones interest and
security had been considered before you were contacted, so be rest assured
and feel free to go into this transaction with 
us.
But let Honesty and Trust be our watchword throughout this transaction and
your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. 
Thank you, and God bless.

Best Regards,

DR. SAMUEL  EBOKA.

YOUR ANTICIPATED ASSISTANT IS REQUIRED.,"""MR.IKE  EJOH"" <IKE_EJOH@YAHOO.COM>",zzzz@example.com,"Wed, 28 Aug 2002 14:41:06 +0200","I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran
ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: 

Thanks and regards. 

MR.IKE EJOH

Attn: How about being a few pounds lighter?OLIBYKN,lworks1@hotmail.com,"leftout@cac.net, jphillips@royal.net, house@cablelan.net, omalleyj@pacbell.net, m93kma@webtv.com","Thu, 29 Aug 2002 19:56:38 -1600","How are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

Attn: How about being a few pounds lighter?OLIBYKN,lworks1@hotmail.com,"leftout@cac.net, jphillips@royal.net, house@cablelan.net, omalleyj@pacbell.net, m93kma@webtv.com","Thu, 29 Aug 2002 19:56:38 -1600","How are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

A better investment than the stock market.,zzzz@webnote.net,zzzz@example.com,"Mon, 02 Sep 2002 02:56:26 -0500","All our mailings are sent complying to the proposed H.R. 3113 Unsolicited

PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN
HIS CLOSET!

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -
New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old
sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,
fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.

""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old
woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my
husband earns in a year"".

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where
he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away
and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet.

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of 
""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom.

""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name
on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever
15-year-old.

The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top
and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to
the top of the list.

The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and
really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues.

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.

""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a
yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I
was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to the
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"".  Over
the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.""  The
money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet, barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his bike
to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, 
fifties and hundreds.

""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks
with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the
lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a
really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next
bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any
reason to be afraid.The reporting news 

team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was
completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,
Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in
the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.

Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter
legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee.

[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What 
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
 YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you
say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the
 Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some
megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".


DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER
THAN EVER.


Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when
I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.

In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the
following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money
for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was 
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in"".

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time 
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the
mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions
and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I
only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I
have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change
anything."" More testimonials later but first,

PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE

++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE
SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT
 CORNER in case of any mail problems.

 When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.


IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority of
your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than
what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!


1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.


PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on
your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a
disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:


METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.


With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals
100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000
orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES
$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......
Grand Total=$555,550.00


NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment
what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people
mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on 
the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just
that, and more!


METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will
easily get a larger response.


We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all
orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report.

=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always
send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

+++ If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks,
continue sending e-mails until you do. =orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT #2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until
you do.

+++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will
continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different
report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you
can generate from this business!!!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS
PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few
weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works
exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your
name and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers
you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, 
materials and opportunity to become financially independent. 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
""junk mail"". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
""I told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on
me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45
days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.
I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".

Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""I was
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big"".

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I
should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone
else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete
this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money
came within 22 weeks"".

                 Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?





If you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minutes presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  

Plus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.

Many are called, few are chosen.  This opportunity will be limited to one qualified individual per state.  Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  

                          *** 801-296-4140 *** 

Please do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.  Looking forward to your call.    

                             *** 801-296-4140 ***

[ILUG] STOP THE MLM INSANITY,shermanm@torchlake.com,ilug@linux.ie,"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 14:18:34 -0500","Greetings! 

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time mailing, so no removal is necessary. 

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. 
The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 
The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 

Cordially, 

Mark R Sherman 

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!

FW: Make Money Fast And Legal! As Seen on TV! 65000$+,MakeMoney@EMXD.legally.com,"Business@webnote.net, Partner@zzzzason.org","Sat, 31 Aug 2002 12:57:22 +0100","THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME 
THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV 
As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. 
I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just 
simply delete it. 
READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy 
weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. 
Believe it, work it. 
This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 
4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders 
(money) 
started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a 
try!! 
You will be glad you did. 
Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't 
delete this!!! 
------------------------------------------------------ 
First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. 
PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN 
IN HIS CLOSET! 
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. 
You most likely have just seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning 
and putting laundry away when she came across a large 
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 
15-year-old sons closet. 
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 
Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 
all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", 
says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 
dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 
earns in a year"". 
The woman immediately called her husband at the 
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 
had discovered. He came home right away and they 
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 
Little did they suspect that where the money came from 
was more shocking than actually finding it in 
the closet. 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 
E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he 
obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for 
the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 
computer in his bedroom. 
""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the 
heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said 
and I started sending it out"", says the clever 
15-year-old. 
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 
on the list, then delete the address at the top and 
move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
your name to the top of the list. 
The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 
weeks if you sent out the letter with your 
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk 
E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 
going to work"", the boy continues. 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him 
for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
$5 bills. 
""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post 
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip 
that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. 
I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He 
goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a 
whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 
home and empty out my backpack because I could not 
carry it all"". 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 
out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I 
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 
barely had time for my homework"". He had also 
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 
area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. 
""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 
time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at 
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 
One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 
my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just 
rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" 
Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 
afraid. The reporting news team examined and 
investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was 
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 
at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to 
US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 
1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also 
in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
must be exchanged for money received. 
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 
little note that read, ""Please send me report number 
XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he 
was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee. 
[This is the end of the media release. If you would 
like to understand how the system works and get your 
$71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below 
is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - 
YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple 
instructions]. 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 
================================================== 
You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your 
home!! 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 
program 
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show 
also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO 
Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS 
PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. 
I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so 
glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received 
total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
=========================================================
=======Here is 
another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a 
long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this 
again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the 
simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 
come 
in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 
made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 
the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first:

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily 
and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and 
AGAIN!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$ 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME 
TRUE, GUARANTEED! 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
================= 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 
reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will 
be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 
in case something happens to your computer. 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed 
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 
than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 
loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, 
this 
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 
could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all 
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change 
anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 
work for you. 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. 
This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 
=========================================================
======= 
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist 
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 
free 
classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 
venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
=========================================================
======= 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 
response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many 
people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 
of 50,000. 
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 
people responded and ordered Report # 2. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 
for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 
total of 
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 
orders for 
Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million). 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 
Total=$555,550.00 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE 
WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL 
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
=========================================================
======= 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 
OUT 
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide 
and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
=========================================================
======= 
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the 
Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 
start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you 
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's 
it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your 
name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise 
until they receive the report. 
===================AVAILABLE REPORTS 
========================== 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always 
send 
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure 
the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On 
one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you 
are ordering, 
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue 
advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN 
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will 
continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your 
name 
is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME 
SEND 
ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS 
AGAIN. There is NO

====================== MORE 
TESTIMONIALS====================== 
'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 
the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 
with 
both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was 
on me! 
Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she 
had 
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have 
joined 
Jody in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
=========================================================
======= '' Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided 
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 
I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised 
when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made 
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is 
that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better 
investment 
with a faster return and so big''. 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
=========================================================
======= '' I had 
received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who 
to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed 
again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 
again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my 
first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
=========================================================
====== 
'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 
362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

Welcome to the concept of RESIDUAL Income!,tim <tim@paychecks4life.com>,zzzz-latestdodgydotcomstock <jm-latestdodgydotcomstock@jmason.org>,"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 05:32:48 -0000","There's only one thing better than a market driven business and 
that's a market driven business that offers consumable products.  
And that is exactly what our system has to offer you.

We offer products that millions of people absolutely must have
and the best part of all, our products are consumable.
 
Why is that so important?

What do you do when you run out of toilet paper?
Do you go watch TV until you see an ad for toilet paper  
do you start cutting up your sheets into small pieces
or do you just GO TO THE STORE AND GET SOME MORE?

You see, not only do our customers enjoy the fantastic benefits
of our products, every time they run out  they come back
to US to GET MORE.  We work with them one time but we get paid
over and over again!

WELCOME TO THE CONCEPT OF RESIDUAL INCOME  money that just 
keeps coming and coming.

What would you do with an extra $1,000 next month?

IF THIS BUSINESS IS SO GREAT, WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO IT 
YOURSELF?

Good question.  And here's your answer.  All of us do!

The fact is that we make even more money each time we help someone
like you get started. WE NEED YOU.  We can't succeed unless we make
you succeed.  We will take you by the hand and walk you through this 
business step-by-step.  WE WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES,  that 
is our commitment to you.

It doesn't take a lot of money, time or knowledge to achieve 
the Dream.  All you need is the right opportunity at the 
right time, a product that sells itself, a plan to follow 
and your own personal coach and mentor.

If you are a motivated person, looking for a positive change, then 
you are in the right place.

If a personal coach and mentor, who cares about you, holding your
hand through the entire process of starting your business sounds 
good,  then this is it!

But we're not looking for JUST ANYONE.  We're looking for 
MOTIVATED people who are SERIOUS about improving the 
QUALITY of THEIR lives.

KEVIN GEORGE

ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIE
WEST AFRICA

Dearest one,

Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebels
in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.

Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next
of kin to my father.

But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a
time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping
me to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.
Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684
I remain yours sincerely,

KEVIN GEORGE

Business Proposal.,barristerbassey@arabia.com,confidential_proposal@mail.com,"Tue, 03 Sep 2002 21:57:56 -0700","BASSEY& ASSOCIATES
FALOMO, IKOYI.
LAGOS - NIGERIA.

FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,

RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents
does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji
Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security
advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. 

With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under
the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last
military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to
the confines of his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal
that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a
security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's
portfolio during his tenure
as chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was that
he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit
with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could
take place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this for
himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he
cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that
can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for
the execution of this endeavour are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six Hundred
Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of
interest to you,you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we
can go 
through the rudiments of this endeavour.

I remain most obliged.

Barrister Williams Bassey (JP).
Principal Partner.- Bassey & Associates

[ILUG] assistance needed,bulawa mulete jr <bulawa123@cheerful.com>,ilug@linux.ie,"Thu, 05 Sep 2002 02:00:11 -0000","ATTN:

I am Bulawa Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, 
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
Forward to coming over to your country to invest our
Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.

NOTE: DO REPLY TO bulmulete@golfemail.com


God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.

URGENT ASSISTANCE(CONFIDENTIAL),matuda steven <stevenmatuda@yahoo.com>,denitto@llamas.net,"Sat, 31 Aug 2002 09:41:43 -0700","Dear sir,,


My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo
Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South
African Information exchange Johannesburg.
.

Due to the previous war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters
to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he
ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all
their farms to his party members and his followers. My
father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman
behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our
country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the
presidnt MUGABE. The president�s supporters invaded my
father�s farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested
him and confiscated all his investment.

Early last year when this victimization of white
farmers by president Mugabe started, my late father
envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all
his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of
Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.
When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a
private security company through the help of his
lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real
contents of the box to the security company, then,
went back home. He registered the box as family
treasure.

While he was still in detention that led to his death
due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South
Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in
Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He
was arrested on the 5th of March last year.
Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of
December 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.

Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and
depressing because my father�s lawyer is presently
hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;
though the lodgment documents are with me, as such I
want to relocate to your country for good. Presently,
my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum
permit as a refugee.

I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the
money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of
this country to your country for investment. If you
think you can help me, Please try to get in touch with
me immediately with the  number below . Your
compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated
if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my
country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep
this information to yourself and secret, because I
wouldn�t want anything that will expose me, and the
existence of this money.

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

STEVEN DUBA (DR).

[ILUG-Social] URGENT ASSISTANT NEEDED,"""MRS. M. SESE SEKO"" <maseko_h3@37.com>",social@linux.ie,"Wed, 04 Sep 2002 20:20:31 +0100","Dear friend,

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. 

This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. 

Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

Do you ever wish you could easily call people you know in other countries
for up to 85% less than standard call prices?! And then to make these savings
without having to subscribe to any low cost calling service?! We have now
launched a product that does exactly that!

You can now call people in most popular destinations around the world for
only 33 cents per minute! There are no hidden charges, you do not need to
signup, use any credit cards, or pay any extra bills! You can try this
service at no risk and choose to use it with no commitment!

To use this new service, simply dial our access number 1530 927 055 and
once connected, dial the actual international number you wish to call.

For more information and the current list of countries you can call, 
please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/

2) Wait until you connect to our system and hear a message asking you
   to dial the number you wish to call.

This double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT.&nbsp; IT DOESN'T BURN ALONE. IT DOESN'T MELT. IT DOESN'T EMIT PHOSGENE.

The test is designed to make porous insulations APPEAR to perform better than they actually do.&nbsp; Measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer, the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago, along with that obsolete fiberglass<BR>garbage they're still selling everybody.&nbsp; There's a reason they don't make refrigerators, freezers coolers &amp; coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it.</P>

<P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">Thank you, Mark and Dik, for your statements above. I also feel that far too often individuals and companies are too complacent and quietly live with rules and regulations without trying to change them&nbsp; -&nbsp; even if everybody knows they do not make sense. We are all experts and representatives of this industry and should speak up and promote change!</P>

We compare standardized insulation to Ceramic coatings via BTU loss calculations.&nbsp; Depending on the criteria we can equal 2 to 3 inches of standard insulation with an aluminum jacket.&nbsp; We have the data and the projects to prove it.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;</FONT> </DIV>

Previous News Releases and Announcements Their statements are set forth in italicized orange type; our replies are in black type. June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: 
""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation."" 
""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) 
The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) 
Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 
miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** 
(Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) 
**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** 
(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and 
the same could be said for DOM. 
**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** 
(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** 
(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) 
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the 
owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** 
Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made 
possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. 
**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. 
""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" 
http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. 
The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: 
**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** 
Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the 
northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. 
The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" 
**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. 
The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** 
Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios 
succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. 
The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999)

June 1, 1999: News Release
Part One Background: 
On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": 
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: �� �� exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). 
�� �� was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, 
Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. 
�� �� was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution 
of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. �� �� has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek �� �� has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as 
- now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political
boundaries."" 
�� �� exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and 
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. �� �� has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political 
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: 
�� �� also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo 
Convention (1933). 
�� �� was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, 
which included the United States, China and the USSR. �� �� was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. �� �� has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. �� �� has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. �� �� exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. �� �� has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of 
EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. 
Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: 
""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
Part Two Background: 
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC, February 1999, states as follows: 
""Where Are OFCs Located? 
[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. 
The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.�� The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.�� The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.�� Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.�� Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.�� The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.�� It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.�� While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.�� The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.�� Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.�� The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. 
While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.�� The refusal of 
the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.�� Your understanding is appreciated.��

December 19, 1998: News Release 
Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio 
The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace.

July 14, 1998: Communiqu�� to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. 
The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'��tre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to 
the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org 
Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. 
The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers.

May 4, 1997: News Release 
Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps 
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. 
BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. 
A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. 
""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. 
CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace.

March 31, 1997: News Release 
An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. 
This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. 
The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. 
However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. 
Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: �� �� ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable 
accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". �� �� ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" 
�� �� ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every 
action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" 
�� �� ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior �� �� ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" �� �� That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". 
The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

February 6, 1995: News Release 
On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 
2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. 
An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. 
On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. 
Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. 
Request for Media Response: 
The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 
1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 
2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 
3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 
4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 
5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 
6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) 
Parting Shot: 
What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry.

November 21, 1994: News Release 
In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. 
The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. 
While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. 
Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. 
Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: �� �� Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. 
�� �� In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed 
Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. �� �� Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. �� �� A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. 
Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military 1 808 923-0476 fax/phone

only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of Côte dIvoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here, he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
Côte dIvoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)

Wall Street's dirty little secret ...,jeremya@msn.com,webmaster@efi.ie,"Sun, 08 Sep 2002 23:07:56 +1000","It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

What Warren Buffett won't tell ya ...,arnoldm@aol.com,webmaster@efi.ie,"Tue, 10 Sep 2002 04:13:50 -1100","It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

through a set-top

[ILUG-Social] urgent assistance,"""Mr. EDWARD MULETE"" <jdmulete@netscape.net>",social@linux.ie,"Mon, 09 Sep 2002 23:16:35 -0000","ATTN:

I am Edward Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara 
Got your contact through her private search.
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
Forward to coming over to your country to invest our
Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.

Please do not use the reply button, reply only to 

Edmulete7@netscape.net Please take note.

God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.

Mr. EDWARD MULETE

My committee - The Niger Delta Development Corporation(NDDC)-which is in
charge of managing and supervising  the disbursement of oil sales revenues
for the Nigerian government.The revenues  under our control runs into
several hundred of millions of dollars monthly.My self and   
other colleagues in the NDDC are currently in need of a foreign partner
with whose bank account we shall transfer the sum of Forty Nine Million
Five Hundred Thosand United States Dollars($49.5m).This fund accrued to us
as commission for oil sales contracts handled under our supervision.

The fund is presently waiting in the Government Account named CBN/FGN
INDEPENDENT REVENUE account number 400-939134 with J.P.MORGAN CHASE
BANK,New York.You can do your independent verification of this. However,
by virtue of our  position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we
cannot acquire this funds in our name. This is because as top civil
servants, we are not allowed by law of the land to own or operate bank
accounts outside our country for now.

I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues,
to look for an overseas partner in whose account we would
transfer the fund

Hence the reason for this mail.We shall be Transferring the money to your
account with your company as we shall present your company as a registered

executed for our country through the NDDC and any other Federal Ministry
that we decide to use to siphon the funds through.

the percentage you wish to be paid when the funds arrive your bank account.

regards to our disposition to continue with you, is subject
to these terms. Firstly, our conviction of your transparency.
Secondly, that you treat this transaction with utmost secrecy
and confidentiality. Finally and above all, that you will provide

(10-14) working days as soon as we reach an agreement and you furnish
me with a  suitable bank account and company name and address with all

[ILUG] Do NOT Drop your Life Insurance,Wesley Gee <lhjr55@yahoo.com>,ilug@linux.ie,"Wed, 11 Sep 2002 06:12:39 -0500","Dear ilug@linux.ie 

Life Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. 
Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.

Why do people sell their policies? 
The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:

Pay off debts 
Fund long term care insurance cost 
Eliminate costly premiums 
Take advantage of other financial opportunities 
Make charitable contributions 
Help family members 
 
  
Life Partners �Living Solutions� 
  
Traditionally, life insurance provides benefits only after death. With Life Partners, it can provide cash benefits for LIFE! 
  
Life Partners Objectives 
Provide market appraisal for life insurance policy owners 
Provide bids for qualified policies 
Provide lump sum cash payments to qualified owners 
Eliminate costly premium payments

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently.

Looking for property in SPAIN?,Dont waste your Time!!!  Why? <wwc1@freeuk.com>,Iiu-list-request <iiu-list-request@zzzzason.org>,"Thu, 12 Sep 2002 13:24:51 +0200","
    
Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time! 
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!! 

The property market is moving very fast here in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present to you a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

Property finders Spain 
can do just that!

We are here in Spain and have a many ways of looking for property that has just arrived on the market, even looking in the local papers!

[ILUG] MICHAEL ! ilug,ilug <ilug@linux.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Mon, 16 Sep 2002 09:33:38 +0200"," ilug ,

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!
 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on

                  Welcome to ""Ghetto"" America!
�...Yes, you heard me; I said ""Ghetto"" America! What is ""Ghetto"" 
America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is 
no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals 
comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!
 
These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica,Aleksandar Gligoric <aleksandar.gilgoric@fiaz.co.yu>,List Member <ler@lerctr.org>,"Mon, 09 Sep 2002 10:11:56 -0000","
       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica,ContraComm International <istina007@yahoo.com>,List Member <ler@lerctr.org>,"Wed, 11 Sep 2002 08:33:28 -0000","
       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

<div class=Section1>


<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life</u> yeah, right!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you

Still looking for a house?,Synteligent Properties <Jeremy@synteligent.com>,ports@FreeBSD.ORG,"Sat, 14 Sep 2002 13:36:40 -0000","My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.

I need those houses...

Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) 

I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. 

If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com 

Best Wishes, 
Jeremy Lessaris

[ILUG] ASSISTANCE,"""COL. MICHAEL BUNDU"" <mikbundu@rediffmail.com>",ilug@linux.ie,"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 15:30:45 +0100","FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236
email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com
Dear Sir/Madam


SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 

Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 
dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange
and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence 
and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the
Democratic Republic of Congo and one of 
the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may 
his soul rest in peace. 

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in
my country, I and some of my colleagues were 
instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. We were then given this money privately 
by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other
Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 
was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 
said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 
(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military
Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President
Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 

In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country 
as the beneficiary. 
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
Cover to a security company in Europe in your 
name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked
''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from
our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
with the late President Kabila, immediately 
after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,
the information We gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks. The said money is a state fund and 
therefore requires a total confidentiality. 

We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in Europe. This is because we are under 
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.

Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's
Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required 
guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as
soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist 
us. 

I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
Thank you and God Bless. 
Best Regards 


COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com

Don't get caught by rising interest rates.,bralbertini21@netscape.net,crew_4@hotmail.com,"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 13:28:38 -0400","Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

"Last time you spent $25 did u make $100,000,s? Well this time you will. wju","""hdwr.Rui Santos"" <jatoy73@bigpond.com>",Undisclosed.Recipients@webnote.net,"Thu, 19 Sep 2002 02:14:46 +1000","Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

More testimonials later but first, =======

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

Never pay eBay listing fees again!,calebn@msn.com,webmaster@efi.ie,"Thu, 19 Sep 2002 01:15:03 +1100","Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

** THE BULKBOOK
Teaches you step-by-step how to become a high profit
bulk emailer.  Secret techniques and tips never
before revealed.

** SEVEN DAYS TO BULK EMAIL SUCCESS
Provides detailed day-by-day instruction to start sending
your first email campaign in seven days.

** 600 Email subjects that PULL LIKE CRAZY

** EMAIL LIST MANAGER
Manage your email lists quickly and easily.  Very 
user-friendly, yet powerful, software.

** STEALTH MASS MAILER
Software can send up to 50,000 emails an hour automatically.
Just load them in there and click SEND!

** ADDRESS ROVER 98 and MACROBOT SEARCH ENGINE ROBOT
Extracts email addresses from databases and search engines
at speeds of over 200,000 per hour.

** WORLDCAST EMAIL VERIFIER
Used to verify your email addresses that you extract to 
make sure they're valid.

** EBOOK PUBLISHER
Easily publish your own e-books and reports for resale using,
you guessed it, bulk email!

** SEVEN MILLION EMAIL ADDRESSES
This huge list will get you started bulking right away.
I harvested these addresses myself, the list is filled
with IMPULSE BUYERS ready to respond to your ads!

If you added up all of the FULL VERSION BULK EMAIL software
included with the BULKBOOK package, it would total over
$499.  I am giving you the whole bundle for only $29.99.
That means there is no other out-of-pocket startup expense

Definitely the answer many have been waiting for!!,itshappening07@yahoo.co.uk,OPtinList <itshappening07@yahoo.co.uk>,"Thu, 19 Sep 2002 22:57:17 +0100","================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============

Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. 


The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!


Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.

BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on

A great product line will not make you money either.
A great compensation plan will not make you money either.
A great company will not make you money either.

Some say it's a combination of the above.
Some say it's what's inside you that matters the most.

Forget about meetings, one-on-one, 3-ways calls, etc.
Those old ways of network marketing has come and gone.
They wear you out long before you make any money.

What makes you money is a downline associated with a
stable company that has consumable products.

Where's the downline coming from?  Well, we have an
online automatic recruiting system that does the work
for you.  Our system will place paying members in 
your downline.

Dear sir/madam

With good recommendation,I  decided to contact you.
I am PRINCE DAVID  SAVIMBI, the son of JONAS SAVIMBI ,the leader of the
UNITA rebel in ANGOLA, who  was killed in february by the troop loyal to
the government .After his funeral  and burial,we had a family meeting and
resolved to invest the money he left  behind in your country, hence this
letter to you.He left the sum of $80 million  us dollars in cash, which was
a proceed from the sale of diamonds,which was  under his control.

However,the entire  development made us to flee ANGOLA to JOHANESBURG,SOUTH
AFRICA, for fear of  being killed.
The amount of $80 million  united states dollars in cash is presently in our
possession, and I would want it  to be invested in your country,due to the
stability of your economy.The money is  presently with an emergency
diplomatic security courier company,which my mother and I hurriedly used to move the
cargo out from our country to SOUTH AFRICA.We  registered it under a security
code with no name, and was registered as  containing photographic paper
material.

My mother and I have resolved to give you  15% of the total sum for your assistance in
getting this funds transferred to  your reliable company's account in your
country,for investment.We have equally  resolved to spend the rest of our
lives in your country.You have to  make traveling arrangement
of coming to JOHANESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA,immediately to  meet with me face to
face and see the funds physically,then have it transferred  to your
account.Afterwhich both of us would travel together to your country for
sharing and immediate investment,then my family will join me later.

As we await your urgent  reply, strictly through my e-mail davsav@maktoob.com or
 davidsavimbi@maktoob.com  or my private phone number +882 1 646685229.  your
absolute trust and confidentiality is highly solicited to serve us better.

Best regard
PRINCE DAVID SAVIMBI    ",1

WET, HORNY AND DIRTY GRANDMAS!

Remember how you lusted after your friend's mum in high
school? She was 46 and you were 15? Remember the time
when she bent over to do her gardening and you saw her
sagging breasts through the v-neck opening of her summer
dress? She was OLD and you LOVED her! All you wanted to
do was FUK that Dirty Old Mole BLUE! You can now! Follow
the link below to see just how OLD & DIRTY these moles are!

[ILUG] Earn 100.000$ in one year working at home,"""Robert@home-based-business.de"" <Robert@home-based-business.de>",ilug@linux.ie,"Sun, 22 Sep 2002 22:02:32 +0200","Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

More testimonials later but first, =======

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

Earn 100.000$ in one year working at home,"""Robert@home-based-business.de"" <Robert@home-based-business.de>",zzzz@example.com,"Sun, 22 Sep 2002 22:32:08 +0200","Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

You can gain from lowest interest rates in 30 years,renato51927@netscape.net,kimk@sprint.ca,"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 00:59:34 -0400","Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

Your eBay account is about to expire!,robertm@att.net,webmaster@efi.ie,"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 05:29:50 +0500","Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

** THE BULKBOOK
Teaches you step-by-step how to become a high profit
bulk emailer.  Secret techniques and tips never
before revealed.

I harvested these addresses myself, the list is filled
with IMPULSE BUYERS ready to respond to your ads!

If you added up all of the FULL VERSION BULK EMAIL software

$499.  I am giving you the whole bundle for only $29.99.

Dont waste your TIME!!! Why?,Looking for property in SPAIN? <wwc1@freeuk.com>,Iiu-list-request <iiu-list-request@zzzzason.org>,"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 21:16:49 +0200","
    
Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time!
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!!

The property market is moving very fast in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present you with a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

 Property finders Spain 
can do just that!

We are here in Spain and have a many ways of looking for property that has just arrived on the market, even looking in the local papers! 

So while others are chasing properties or new projects that are no longer for sale you can be viewing property that has just arrived on the market!

Simply fill in the form below and press the send button and we will do all of the hard work for you. 

Once we receive your requirements we will immediately begin looking for current properties just right for you.

[ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount.,Hugh5546x73@bigfoot.com,ilug@linux.ie,"Tue, 24 Sep 2002 01:31:44 +1200","Hi -

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 informtion

""Send me a free membership!""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with
""Remove"" in the subject line.  By submitting a request for a FREE
DHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for
both their consumer and business opportunities.

[ILUG-Social] re: how to register one of the new domain extensions,victor_murray@hotmail.com,social@linux.ie,"Wed, 25 Sep 2002 04:23:33 -0700","IMPORTANT DOMAIN INFORMATION:


The new domain names are finally available to the general public at discount prices. Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95.

The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.  Visit: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/ today for more info.

[ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount.,Hugh6626t76@bigfoot.com,ilug@linux.ie,"Wed, 25 Sep 2002 09:45:21 -0400","Hi -

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 information

""Send me a free membership!""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with
""Remove"" in the subject line.  By submitting a request for a FREE
DHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for
both their consumer and business opportunities.

BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP(URGENT/CONFIDENTIAL),"""MR.VINCENT NNAJI."" <vinnet@mail.com>",zzzz@example.com,"Thu, 26 Sep 2002 04:22:43 +0200","Mr.Vincent Nnaji,
 Standard Trust Bank Ltd,
 Lagos,Nigeria.
 Dear Sir,
 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 
Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 
Thanks and Regards,
 MR.VINCENT NNAJI.

Partnership.,"""Mrs. Anne Kojo"" <annekojo@email.com>",zzzz-iiu@jmason.org,"Wed, 25 Sep 2002 16:46:33 -0700","Dear Sir, 
With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions. 
Note: There is no risk involved in this business. 
Remain Blessed, 
MRS. ANNE  KOJO

[ILUG] WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE TO INVEST IN YOUR COUNTRY,VICTOR SANKOH <victorsankoh@mail.com>,ilug@linux.ie,"Fri, 13 Jul 2001 10:53:02 +0200","Dear Sir/Madam,

I am well confident of your capability to assist me in
a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish with you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.

Well, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY
SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars).

This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond
by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.

Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of C�te d'Ivoire.

Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from C�te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount at the end of this business. The security
of this business is very important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply.
Thank you and God bless you.

Faeries,About Time <evtwqmigru@datcon.co.uk>,wciml@chez.com,"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 23:01:36 -1900","UNCOMMON EXOTIC PLEASURE BOTANICALS!

Feeling marvelous, Mood-Sensitive, Mood-Enhancing, Depressive/Regressive, ""Sweet Treat"" forumulations for the Pleasuring and Well-Being of Body, Mind & Spirit from the planet's foremost ""Sensitive"" ethnobotanical cooperative -- Exotic Botanical Resources! (Product descriptions, pricing and deep-discounted Intro Offers information below.)

SEVENTH HEAVEN ""SWEET TREAT"" MENU 

1. SHANGRILA ZOWIE WOWIE (tm) (Gnarly Sweet Grass).  Absolutely, the most significant legal ""Personal Choice"" non-cannabis, non-marijuana, non-tobacco smoking botanical on the planet.

6. CAPILLARIS HERBA (tm) A sedate smoking and/or brewing Happiness  Botanical. 

********************************
**Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)**
********************************

""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba.

Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)

This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!

We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.

Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
* ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!
* 4 – 5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.
* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)
* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!
* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.
* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No ""munchie"" factor.
* No failed drug tests!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time....

**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************

High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.

This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.

Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. 

Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) 

Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.
