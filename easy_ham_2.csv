Well, first, when exmh (the latest one with your changes) starts, I get...

can't read ""flist(totalcount,unseen)"": no such element in array
    while executing
""if {$flist(totalcount,$mhProfile(unseen-sequence)) > 0} {
	FlagInner spool iconspool labelup
    } else {
	FlagInner down icondown labeldown
    }""
    (procedure ""Flag_MsgSeen"" line 3)

    (procedure ""Msg_Show"" line 7)
    invoked from within

    invoked from within
""Folder_Change $exmh(folder)""
    (procedure ""Exmh"" line 101)
    invoked from within
""Exmh""
    (""after"" script)

which is probably related to my not having an ""unseen"" sequence anywhere
(certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I
tried this new exmh ...

Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen
which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace
that with.   There's obviously a way as the ""Sequences"" menu does this.
The ""Mark Unseen"" menu entry in the message ""More"" menu is still wanting
that function as well...

  | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to
  | display the other sequences.

Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached
folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...

I have space for more sequences, in the ""unseen"" window, as long as they
remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be
ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall
off the bottom, and not be shown).

I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,
just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with
background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or
other decorations, but made ""sticky"" - the appearance is just like the
folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the
root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around
and do I can see when new mail needs processing).

I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur
in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to
the ""sequences to always show"" and ""sequences to never show"", a
preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder
would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the
folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.
This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining
productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message
in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,
it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is
packed, sorted, etc).

I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this
next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the
bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains ""unseen"" and ""urgent"".
It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder
happens to have defined.   A ""New sequence"" entry would also be useful
(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,
which can be done now using ""Search"" and the pick interface, but is
clumsy that way)

Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name
in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the
list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...

syntax error in expression ""int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))""

    (command bound to event)

It has been ages since I did this last though.   I tried adding a Subject
to pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference.
Looks as if something is now saying ""1 hit"" when before it didn't, or
similar.

  | I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
  | week or so ago.

Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is
more apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere,
the background of the ftoc line isn't very wide).

Hope this helps.

No it wasn't, and at one point it worked fine.  I'll check and see why it 
stopped working.

I've never seen pseq either.

BTW, it's kinda amusing for a short while to show the cur sequence.  Watching 
that helped me find a number of bugs.

My bad - I had 'Previous-Sequence: pseq' in my .mh_profile from long ago and

{Msg_Mark unseen}

I'm not sure how I missed the need to fix this in app-defaults for ""Mark 
Unseen"".  I guess that'll be my next CVS fix.

I thought about that.  The first order approximation would be to just add 
using pack .... -side top instead of pack ... -side left, however, since their 
each a different width, it would look funny.

The background color in this window is the same as the background 
color in the ftoc.

The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined in 
app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.  I've been thinking about 
how to dynamically generate highlighting for other sequences, but haven't got 
that figured out yet.

I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.

Ah....I think this may be a user error.  If you change the field in the 
preferences window the variable doesn't actually change unless you press 
return.  If you merely click elsewhere, nothing happens.

exmh uses the profile setting - it appears as mhProfile(unseen-sequence)
in the code.

Until this patch, exmh was full of hardcoded references to unseen.  One of the 
things I did was to change these to look in the already available global 
variable with the value in it (which other parts of the code did use).

Anyway, I've just fixed the performance problem with repeatedly reading the 
sequences files.  I'll patch it in after I've run it for a while.

[ILUG] Update on  PC Cases,Justin MacCarthy <macarthy@iol.ie>,"""Ilug@Linux.Ie"" <ilug@linux.ie>","Wed, 21 Aug 2002 13:03:30 +0100","Hi all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you
all. Thanks for your suggestions.

Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU
fan.

I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg£133.86)
but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.
It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3½"" drive bays so I should be ok for
future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work
on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come
off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb
screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands
off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3
different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box
is big and has loads of room inside.
Oh... and it looks very cool :-)

However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says

* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!
* ATX Power supply sold separately

In fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I
ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.
Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the
USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from
that show) but I missed that :-)

I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.
(thanks Mike)

So now I can code-in-peace...

Get a very, *very* small set of drill bits.  Start drilling right
through the center of the head, at a slow speed so you don't pop
off and through the board!  Once you have a bit of an indent in,
increase the speed a little bit.

If you've made a deepish indent, and the head doesn't pop off, use
the next largest drill bit you have.  Repeat until happy.

Eventually the head should just pop off, allowing you to lift the
board off over the shaft of the screw... then ye can take out the
rest fairly easily with a pliers or whatnot.

Yeah, I figured that, but it doesn't seem to ... well, if that's the case
I'll give it another go tonight, maybe come back with some error messages.

Just to clarify for those who didn't understand me initially - I have a
floppy drive installed, but it doesn't physically work. There's nowhere
handy to pick one up where I am, and I don't fancy waiting a few days for
one to arrive from Peats.

Hi Tim,
It isn't a ""version"" of anything except NeXTSTEP, with a Mac hackjob.
It has a bastardised, but functional BSD -layer- which sit's atop Mach and
uses case insensitive HFS+ but it isn't really a BSD.

(Here's a neat trick, touch ""Makefile"" and ""makefile"", notice the lack of
error message but the absence of ""makefile"", and don't bother formatting for
UFS. The Apple UFS implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97,

now and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving UFS2 in there
somewhere down the road. )

Then there's the holdover NeXT inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions
of common Unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you
would usually append to them have to go through NetInfo Manager.

All in all, I find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop
environment.

Every new Mac comes with an upgrade 10.2 CD as of last week.
So if you bought one on the 12th, you'd be running 10.2 before the release
this Friday night.

Good luck with that, even Mac geeks have a longer upgrade cycle than the

[ILUG] redhat kickstart,deccy@csn.ul.ie,ilug@linux.ie,"Wed, 21 Aug 2002 20:15:54 +0100","How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your

As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.

Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.

Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,

Postfix provides a binary called /usr/sbin/sendmail that does the right
thing. Which, presumably involves sticking your outgoing going message
in the right queue. Then you need your postfix SMTP client to
authenticate with your postfix SMTP server. Are you using SASL? If so,
I remember seeing documentation on how to configure the postfix SMTP
client to authenticate.

depends on what you are using to dial. for debian put ""demand"" in

You're going to get Significant Frowns from your average cat breeder
if you say you want a cat who looks like a Pokémon.

Why is that Pokémon called ""Persian"", anyway - it looks nothing like a
Persian cat?  It does look like a Siamese or (more likely)
Abyssinian.  If you want one of these breeds, I hope you're prepared
to part with €BIGNUM; they're not cheap.

There aren't a lot of ""quality"" cat breeders in Ireland, and they tend
not to have many kittens for sale, so I don't know how feasible it is
to get a Siamese or Abyssinian in a hurry.  ""Not very"", is my best
guess.

> I see the Burmese are nice but I like the pointy ears of the

Siamese *in general* aren't the friendliest of cats; they tend to be
slightly overbred and you end up with hissing maniacs as a result.
Abys tend to be nicer, and Burmese nicer still.  You can be lucky with
individual cats, though.

Yep 450 yoyo's for a wee one, thats a lot of fish food. And I might not even

[ILUG-Social] Completely silent pc,Greg Farrel <greg@netsoc.tcd.ie>,social@linux.ie,"Fri, 19 Jul 2002 23:21:14 +0100","Hi, 
I'm looking to build a completely silent pc. It's gonna be a gateway for
a wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only
spitting distance from the chimney where i'll be mounting the aerial) 
It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need? 

I'll prob use a shitty p166 i have here, it doesnt have a fan, and I'm not
worried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?) 
any info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new
shoebox size totally silent pcs and I cant use an old laptop as I have a
pci wireless card and cable already bought (160$ or so)

And where can I get a fanless psu? I know they exist because the lads
at antefacto had them (lads, where can I get one?). Although I do remember
a slight lack of metal box around the humongous voltage parts!

its mostly mice though. and they will eventually (after a few summers)
stop bringing their kills back to the house, once they realise that
you're not interested and are never going to learn to hunt.

hmm. there are versions of OpenBSD that run from a 32M compact flash IIRC.

and antefacto's software ran in 64M.

there are CF->IDE adapters anyway, so get a 256M CF (100€+), mount it RO,
and use that?

/me is also in the market for one of the 60W fanless PSU's that antefacto had,
if someone wants to get a few of them.

An old laptop would probably be ideal.  That way, it comes with its own 
UPS (the battery).

Some people strip down old 486 boxes, take out the hard drive, disable
the fans, and run the thing from just a floppy drive or a CDR you've
burned for the purpose.

if i go to a class, i'm there to learn.  if they throw in anthems or
politics, i'll take what i can learn from that and i'll take in a new
perspective, but i'll only do that with my critical thinking cap on.
just like i do when i watch mass media.  and yes, from the one irish
course i took in dublin, they do the national anthem.  which is fine
really - i started off each day in school in america with the pledge of
allegience (with the under god bit in it which annoyed my dad to no end).
if that sort of thing didn't stick at the age of five, i severely doubt
it will stick now.

there's a huge opportunity for a fully irish computing environment in
free software.  and yet i don't see much action from official irish
organisations.  the reason mandrake and some others have the irish
support they have is because of individuals like donnacha.

Just a note to say that the Basque government has payed for having
Mandrake translated to Basque (and release all the changes), so that you
can just install it and the desktop and apps can be in your language. I
think that whichever organization (Irish government I suppose) is in
charge of promoting Irish here could learn a lot from them. 

The Basque government used to pay MS for translating Windows, but they
got pissed off because it was extremely expensive and the translations
would come out when the software was already obsolete. Now they promote
Free Software while helping the language at the same time, I think it's
a win-win situation ;).

cheers,
Arkaitz

this is serious. the highly confidential information that dermot is
out of the office has leaked! i think it would be best if we all
email the ""Systems Manager"" as a matter of urgency. in lieu of an
email address i suggest emailling all of postmaster, info, sales,
hostmaster, webmaster, support and accounts (and any other address
one can think of).

now, considering the critical nature of this leak, if you do not 
receive an adequate reply i think one would be duty bound to raise 
the matter again, and again if needs be, until one gets a 
satisfactory reply.

also, i notice a lot of people on this lot who post from company 
addresses do not have disclaimers on their emails. i would encourage 
everyone in a professional position to raise the matter of 
disclaimers internally and ensure that disclaimers are implemented 
for company emails, stationary and phone systems.

finally, the email-disclaimers advocacy site 

	http://www.emaildisclaimers.com/

may prove to be a useful resource. rather strangely one of the quotes 
on the front-page of their site is:

	'The disclaimers added to the end of emails are not legally 
	binding, but it's always good practice to try and disclaim liability'

	-- Michael Chissick, Head of Internet law at Field Fisher 
	Waterhouse

However, i suggest this quote, partly the initial part, be ignored
and that other more favourable quotes (by self-aggrandising
pundits^W^Wleading experts)  be heeded instead.  Also, there is a
vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large
company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some
kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having
implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a
rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).

not legal, more management/corporate fashion. cause most of the
actual /legal/ opinion on the web i've found on the web indicates:

1. they should be used /sparingly/

blanket pre/appending of disclaimers /dilutes/ any legal
effectiveness they have.

2. they are not binding, and have little meaning other than in 
certain situations.

they are not binding. 

though there are some situations where for proffessional reasons one
may wish to indicate the standing of an email. (eg legal advice ""this
is / is not legal advice"" type of thing. But again, this means 
disclaimers need to context-specific. (see 1.)

3. there is precedence that blanket disclaimers, under UK law, have 
no standing and that rather (common sense this) it is the context of 
the situation that determines the legal effects of an email.

See the norwich union case. 

Anyway, my top tips to help superiors who've fallen for disclaimers 
to see sense:

1. server side appends breaks email standards. (unless always done 
correctly - nearly impossible, cause then server has to understand 
every possible type of client encoding).

1a. it /does/ break certain types of encryption, that depend on the 
body being untouched. (eg X.509? kate brought this up ages ago).

1b. iirc, it contravenes MIME to pre/append non mime-typed text. Most 
mailers will work around this and display the mail 'correctly', some 
might not though. Eg the message might not be displayed, or the 
disclaimer might not be displayed.

1c. the correct place for disclaimers is on the client side. this 
also allows the user to select appropriate disclaimer for appropriate 
context (or no disclaimer at all).

2. blanket appended disclaimers are of dubious legal effectiveness. 
(dilution, NU case in UK)

3. generic disclaimer text is of dubious legal effectiveness. indeed
it will often be completely inappropriate ('this message is
confidential' on list mail). see 1c. Also, it needs to be written by 
an actual lawyer.

4. A lot of big multinational corporations do /not/ append 
disclaimers. (ones i know of: Compaq (deceased), Motorol (iirc), 
Microsoft (iirc)).

Useful link:

http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/
(and see links at bottom of this page).

finally, if you cant get reason to prevail and you have to agree to
implementing server side disclaimers, you can still resort to:

	""that'll be done just as soon as the company stationary has
	disclaimers printed on them. oh, and i guess we'll have to play a
	disclaimer before or after all our telephone calls too? 
	Wait, that would cause a problem for faxes wouldnt it?""

Having recently checked out both of these, for a selection of
books, the exact same basket of books cost more in both .de and
.fr (taking delivery charges, VAT et al into account) than buying
the same thing in amazon.co.uk

The books I used to check were 
1) C unleashed (Heathfield et al)
2) Design Patterns (Gamma et al)
3) Computer Graphics, principles and practice (Foley et al)

I was hugely surprised that amazon.co.uk worked out cheapest - by
a considerable margin, too - something like 12 euros after
freight was taken into account.

Cheers,
Dave.

there was a copy of Doom 1 that came free with RedHat 5.2 - 
unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be on the newer CDs.

get the last laugh by going in, and saying that ID soft actually 
released a Linux wrapper for the game. you need to buy the CDs, though, 
then download the free wrapper.

Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screening

To all,

I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa
Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate
IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake.

Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend
the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen
REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to
hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am
trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I
would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print
of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a
theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to
quickly set up a screening for its members.

I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I
originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of
REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and
none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.  

One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open
Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another
SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter
to Hobbyists.  

The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement,
but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open
Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about
the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a
vegetarian.  

I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects
worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many
aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary
on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be
punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by
having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my
feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you
see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.  

I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing
is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. 
However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at
home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a
university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized
screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I
believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should
retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement
is not voluntary then it is really just piracy.

One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of
the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin
selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a
license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use
the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the
DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford
to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of
preserving the educational/institutional market.

Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists
that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the
artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of
REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. 
It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked
full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will
get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek
out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.

I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for
REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you
will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested
persons to legally view it.

I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening
at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone.

Sincerely,

J.T.S. Moore
Director, REVOLUTION OS

duly noted

definately would make the extra effort to talk directly with these people
and mention to the IFC (local arts cinema) about a more approriate
showing.

Would enough people in ILUG be interested to cover the possible costs
of a showing some Saturday afternoon/morning.

Anyway this is distant future anyway i have too much on my plate already.

I hope the DVD they produce wont be region coded, damned anti-consumer
cartels and monoplistic tendencies of coporate greed.

Is this the same film the 2600 people are always going on about or is that
something else?

 do your (and my) favourite, it'll be Ok:

  1. cpio(1) preserves hard links, i.e., if F1 and F2 are
     hard-linked and both are ""copied"", then the ""copies""
     are also hard-linked.  this is true of all `cpio's
     (and `tar' and any other decent/usable archival tool,
     by definition (IMHO)).

  2. `cpio -p' (at least `GNU cpio version 2.4.2') will only
     read/write (copy) the actual data bytes once.  I _think_
     this is true for all `cpio's (not just that GNU version),
     but am not certain.

 if you use an intermediate archive, e.g.:

    cpio -o ... >file;   ...;   cpio -i ... <file

 then the actual data bytes are copied into the archive (file)
 under each name (e.g., as both F1 and F2).  but GNU `cpio' is
 smart about this in pass-through mode (`-p'), copying the data
 just once (or so I read the source).

cheers!
	-blf-

p.s. assuming this is a one-time operation that you won't repeat
    anytime soon (e.g., never; i.e., time isn't a major issue),
    and are not using any intermediate media/file (so storage
    isn't an issue), then even if `cpio' did read the data twice,
    so what? --- as long as, of course, it re-creates the hard
    links.  which it will.

How about something like:

cd {dest.dir}
tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -

tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This
should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep
the owners too... :)

Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well.

 that will make a difference, at least in time and CPU
 resource consumed (albeit, in this case, not storage).

 the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
 contain the data for each name of a hard link.  this is
 (probably) for several reasons, and is not necessarily a
 bad thing.   e.g., it provides a degree of redundancy to
 help cope with bad media.

 the source `tar' is creating an archive, which is being
 written down the pipe (to be consumed by the sink `tar').
 that is why storage is not an issue per se here, as the
 full archive is not ""saved"" --- if it were, you'd need
 at least 2x60Gb, or over 120Gb!   (the extra is `tar's
 overhead, which is minimal but does add up, esp. when
 a ""large"" blocking factor is used.)

Eh?!? Oh wait... <pause while original mail is re-read>

Doh. Sorry, I automatically read 'soft' in front of 'links', despite all
evidence to the contrary. I thought the original question was a bit
strange...

On that note: is there any real benefit to using hard links? I avoid them as
a rule, and cannot think of any good reason to use them at the moment.

There are lots of benefits to using hard links, for all sorts of reasons. In
this case, they are being used to provide two quite different namespaces
for the same set of files.

I did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my 
files were in the way.

Then I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
fetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At 
339M that took almost 3 hours.

Now I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D 
patches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in 
the process. 

Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
in under 20 hour increments.

Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I'm trying to
think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I'm a little
stumped. There's gotta be some benefit that I'm missing that's
immediately obvious to everyone.

Using Niall's example - single set of files but >1 namespace, and suppose that
you want to delete some items from the set according to rules applied to the
namespaces.  With soft links you need an *extra* namespace the others refer to,
and after filtering the namespaces, you have to do a manual reference count to
decide what goes and what stays.  With hard links, you just unlink and deletion
is automatic.

 profuse apologies, the wrong version of my reply was posted
 (blame it on being late for the pub).  ;-(

 the above is almost pure B*S* --- I got my `tar's and `cpio's
 confused.  what I said _is_ correct, but for cpio(1) archives;
 tar(1) archives do _not_ replicate the data for hard links.

 I spotted this confusion on my part before I posted my reply,
 and re-wrote it to be more correct, yet somehow the wrong

 anyways, GNU `cpio -p' does not do spurious reads or writes.
 GNU `tar cf - ... | tar xf - ...' also does not, albeit each
 `tar' both reads and writes the data.  hence, there is twice
 (not thrice!) the I/O of `cpio -p', maybe an issue for c.60Gb.

 using strace(1), I've verified my claim GNU `cpio -p' does
 not do spurious reads or writes, i.e. it link(2)s.  but having

 with extra skepticism ......   ;-\

 maybe, maybe not.   yonks ago, I seem to recall dmr saying,

 that soft and hard links both make sense in isolation, but
 having both does not.  if this is even close to correct,
 yer in quite good company!

 there is at least one notable difference, and a host of minor
 ones.  the notable difference is the data always exists (and
 is apriori accessible) for hard links --- there is no such
 thing as a broken link.

 I use this fact on occasion to ""save"" data, via the well-
 known attack of hard-linking to a supposedly-temporary file
 I want to preserve.  the subsequent unlink(2)ing of the
 ""temporary"" file does not destroy the data.

Or point me in the direction of a site that does GPL case studies where there may be a similar issue. I have had a google around and the PHP site wasn't help full and the GPL page didn't seem to have this senario.

The setup is as follows:
I develop a piece of code using PHP 3.0.9 which is, to
my knowledge, GPL. 

The piece of code runs on my server and is an integral part of a system that I have developed for a client. I did not recieve  payment for this particular piece of code but I did recieve payment for the system. My client now wants to  
use a different service provider but keep my code. 
Do I have a right to claim intellectual property rights for  my little piece of code that he did not pay me for or do I have to give the client the code under the GPL.

Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the ""Deleted Items"" folder.

In the root of a hard drive, create a directory "".unwanted"". Then
periodically create hard links to every file on the hard drive that does not
have hard links.

That way, when someone accidentally does ""rm *"" or whatever, you still have
a link under "".unwanted""

Another script can then periodically clear out enough old files to ensure
that there is usually enough disk space.

Although this sounds like a horrible hack. It would no doubt be much better
to have a transaction oriented file system with a rollback facility.  :)

so yeah, unrm would be nice, but obviously it's not a simple problem.
millions of lines of code, hundreds of projects, no unrm.  heck, the

php's license is completely irrelevant to this.  think about it.
solaris releases their system which includes /bin/sh.  their license
is very restrictive and they retain the rights to their whole system.
but they don't own every shell script ever written by solaris admins

mh used them nicely.  mh stores one message per file.  the refile command
allows you to move a message from one folder to another *or* link it to
another folder.  it uses hard links to do this.  this would suck to if
it used soft links - what if i later deleted the actual file?

 Bind configs are one sort of file.

 I think the person asking Kevin the question would like to have a nice
config language like:

 domain: ""bing.com""
 hosts:  www mail arse smeg twitter
 ttl:    20000

 and then using lex & yacc, they could write a program that converts
between that config file, and the tedious bind configs, and maybe even
auto-generate a reverse DNS config file while they are at it.

 Personally, I think they are demented. It's much more a job for something
simple like Sed or Awk. People using lex & yacc just because they can make
baby jesus cry.

 That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as equally

It's not hard math - jpeg is a straight block-based DCT with
quantisation - which is about the oldest image compression
algorithm out there, and I think certainly predates 1986. So I
really have no idea what they claim they've patented - doin DCT
on 8x8 blocks of an image, quantising the resulting coefficients,
or DCT in general? I'm extremely skeptical about this whole
story...

MPEG 1, 2, 4 or 7? They're all very different compression
algorithms.

Anyway, here's to ogg, and hopefully the future mpeg4-standard
compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers
crossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition
the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having
failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their
responsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in
court.

[ILUG] Samba login question,Niall O Broin <niall@linux.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Mon, 22 Jul 2002 05:39:37 +0100","I have a situation with a small network as follows:

A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will
run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let
VMware access local linux disks.

An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients
access to its filesystems.

How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running 'doze

down through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I
never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc.

Keep an eye on eBay.  One annoyance of eBay is that many sellers state ""will
ship to US only"".  However, I've found that if you ask nicely, they will
usually ship over here.  For payments, either setup a paypal account or
post the seller a US dollar bank draft.  I've got lots of little bits and
pieces that way (for example, finally got my hands on a rackmount kit for
my DECserver 700 terminal server which I'd been looking for for ages, for
a total of US$15).

You can't; hard links only. And those get cleaned up by ScanDisk as
""cross-linked files"". Shortcuts are the Windows analogue of symlinks,
and they don't work outside the Windows environment - i.e. they're an
artifact of the OS rather than the FS.

You know it's stupid - I know it's stupid. Nonetheless, Microsoft has tried
to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people
(often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so
much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their
company's entire IP public. (I don't think Microsoft said precisely what I
jsut said, but that was the tenor of the remarks). And their marketing
budget is a tad bigger than yours or mine.

Having skimmed over the patent, it appears to be describing a sort of
image compression algorithm which gels more or less with the JPEG
mechanism. Since I don't quite understand how jpeg works (it's hard
math, and I'm just a dumb comp. eng.) I don't know how exactly it
matches up to JPEG. I'm more curious as to whether it covers MPEG,
because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than
stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG
compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references
also seems to hint at MPEG.

Let's all use PNG, eh? *cough* *wheeze*

Cheers,
Waider.

but that's just stupid.  microsoft s/w covers a subset of applications
that are under the gpl.  there are gpl word processors, there's a
microsoft wp; there are various language compilers and interpreters under
the gpl, microsoft has their visual compilers.  and so on.  and just
like the gpl apps, the microsoft apps are distributed under a license.
that license says lots of things, and there are various licenses used by
microsoft, but in a nutshell they all pretty much say: you can't copy,
distribute or modify their s/w; you can't sell it multiple times.

so does anyone think that applies to their wp documents or their visual
c++ code?

the dated address that my from appears as is a good address for five days
for anyone.  after that it requires a confirm message from the sender.
my regular email address requires a confirm address if i haven't
explicitly given permission to the sender.

and yes, spammers could try to set up a system to reply to my confirm
messages, but that would require them to a) give out a valid email address
in their From headers, and b) use a lot more bandwidth then they do now
(thereby costing them more money).

oh, and they can't forge confirm messages.  the confirm message system
works something like this:

    message goes in the pending q and is assigned an id.
    that id is encrypted and used to create the from address of the
	outgoing confirm mail - kevin+confirm+kghdsfg@ie.suberic.net
    only a message to that address will work to free the message from
	the q (or i can free it using tmda-pending).

all of this is discussed on http://tmda.sf.net/

[ILUG] Optimising for PentiumMMX?,John Gay <johngay@eircom.net>,ilug@linux.ie,"Sun, 21 Jul 2002 19:06:06 +0100","I've been playing with an old Dell OptiPlex5110 and decided to attempt to 
build a PentiumMMX optimised Linux on it.

To start, I installed the bare minimum Debian system for  compiling programs.

Next I built a custom kernel, since most CPU optimizations are best suited to 
the kernel code.

Next I built X4.2.0 from sources, especially since X make a lot of use of 
matrixes and can also benifit from MMX optimizations. Since the first build, 
I've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff, 
so I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.

Finally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage 
of the MMX processor.

Can anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even 
more improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or 
do benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian 
compiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?

I am wondering if the C, and other libraries  should be re-built? Can they 
take advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance? 
And would this require re-building gcc as well?

I realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I 
would see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the 
kernel, X and KDE should improve performance.

On a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking 
for a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX 
M/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another 
I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the 
SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing 
two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch 
the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not 
had much luck.

uh, i wouldn't.  i was referring to the previous message which discussed

yes.  i did fail to mention that floyd might not use inode 111, but
it might.  and that was my point, having these mythical symlinks point
to the device+inode is not simple.  just like the unrm thing, it might
be possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations
that have survived to date on unix.  windows shortcuts are kinda weird -
they're really an application level thing.

mac aliases seem to take the idea of unix symlinks (linking by filename)
along with the concept of device+inode.  i don't know mac internals,
but i seem to remember being told it tried the former first, and then
tried the latter.  how it would deal with the 2nd example i mentioned i
dunno - i'm not certain if the mac version of inodes would suffer from
that (maybe the fs identifier for the file included the creation time
or something like that).

> how do i control this 'symlinks magically link to new files' feature?

i think it would be difficult.  it would also fail to work in numerous
situations.

Conor who only knows about symbolic links ;-))

I'm pretty sure that I have a softlink from
/mnt/public/mnt/public/downloads/Linux/wasteCPU/setiathome to
/home/cwynne/seti

The /mnt/pub....../seti.. directory resides on an external raidvolume and
/home/../seti is on the internal IDE2 drive. 
So I dont have to cd around the gaf. I suppose that would count as across
different devices. 

If you're wondering [probably not] why /mnt/public is there twice, its
because I restored from tapebackup and I didn't know that it keeps the
directory structure. I know now ;-)

Actually, how can I fix that quickly and easily? I thought about firstly
mv'ing the structure to /tmp. Then copying it back again but I'm sure some
wee genius knows a quickie solution. Mind you I never even bothered trying a
its not a priority now that its all linked anyway. 

CW

--------------------------------
 hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea.

 but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites.

 ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the ""snapshot""
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various ""versioning"" filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... )

 one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.

So, they're the same as hard links, with the disadvantage that they
break on deletion or moving, and they may take up slightly more disk
space. Hmm.

RE: [ILUG] When is a wav not a wav?,"""Wynne, Conor"" <conor_wynne@maxtor.com>","'John Gay' <johngay@eircom.net>, ilug@linux.ie","Mon, 22 Jul 2002 15:53:54 +0100","I'm sure that The Beatles are weel happy with Microserfs for robbing them
blind of their ""intellectual Property""

I'm gonna mail complaints@microsoft.com and get them to put an end to these
windows cd's ;--)

Don't suppose you have a reference for it? I've made a lot of friends in the
MS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away
with it --::)))

CW

And no sorry I don't know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality
though if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded
or some buzz like that. 

---------------------
I've got some really interesting wav files here.

A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .

Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and 
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!

Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this
collection!

I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the 
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25 
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. 

Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to 
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it
doesn't 
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them 
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!

xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does not

have any position control so you just have to listen to the album from start

to finish.

file has this to say about them:

johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM, 
stereo 22050 Hz
johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV
-r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAV

And this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, 
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in
stereo.

What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for 
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange 
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but 
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums 
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV 
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Cheers,

	John Gay

So what this tells us is:
1) There are very few new ideas.
2) Problems exists until someone gets annoyed enough to actually fix them
rather than find bizarre ways to solve the problem.
3) I have too much creative time on my hands with not enough productive

  | That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as
  | equally broken, rather than standing up and saying ""how about
  | we try & make everyone better"".

 eh?  POSIX doesn't ""do"" anything.  POSIX is a de jour
 specification for a voluntary minimal implementation to
 encourage software transportability.  no-one, absolutely
 no-one, has or ever had to implement POSIX or be restricted
 to POSIX.  commercial considerations et.al. may encourage
 some ""POSIX-compatibility"", but that's a freely-made choice.

 IMHO, the process's weakness is a general rule --- which
 has been ignored on occasion --- to only consider ""formal""
 submissions of ""proven"" technologies.  that translates into
 specifying more-or-less common parts of the existing *ix
 implementations which actively contribute to the process.
 most of the committees are loath to blue-sky, solicit
 proposals/research, or pick an uncommon or unsponsored
 implementation, even when manifestly superior.  (IMHO,
 this is why POSIX is *ix and not, e.g., Plan9 or Inferno.)

 OTOH, considering the motivating force behind the process,
 it can be argued the above ""weakness"" is a strength ....

  | (why? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck)

 yep.  which is not to say POSIX ""sucks"" per se.  but the old
 pre-POSIX *ix world arguably did, at least in terms of ease
 of software porting.  one of *ix's claims to fame is it is
 perhaps the first system where one could seriously consider
 porting, more or less intact and with relative ease, software
 from one architecture+platform+vendor to a radically utterly
 different triple.

 however, as people discovered, there's a lot of difference
 between ""consider porting"" and ""actually porting"" --- and
 some problems were silly.  some were self-inflicted (e.g.,
 assuming byte-orientation or a particular endianness); but
 others were Frustrating ""system"" incompatibilities --- the
 motivating force that lead to /usr/group, XPG (X/Open), POSIX,
 Spec1170, Unix98, Common Unix, &tc.

      choose from.»   -- commonly attributed to bwk.

  | It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
  | program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output
  | of cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:
  |

 2|    cmd1 <&3 | cmd2 >&3
 3|    exec 3>&-
  | 
  | but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
  | incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions?  [ ... ]

 the above, or something close to it, would work if, when the
 1st line is executed, file descriptor (fdesc) 1 is open for both
 read and write (R/W) to a suitable entity (e.g., a pipe/FIFO; I
 imagine a socket or something of that ilk could be made to work
 but have no idea why you'd want to go to the trouble.... ).

 but in any case, all that is unlikely to be the case:
  · most probably, fdesc 1 is yer tty (e.g. screen + keyboard);
 and
  · quite possibly is open only for write (being stdout).

 you need it open for R/W because all dup2(2) --- which is all
 `n>&m' means -- does is replicate the fdesc handle.  it does not
 change the access mode; e.g., if the original fdesc (m) was only
 open for writing (W), that's all the new fdesc (n) is open for.
 yet in the 2nd line, it's needed for both R (cmd1) and W (cmd2).

 whilst it's impossible to say for certain from this excerpt, it
 seems a reasonable guess that fdesc 1 when the 1st line executes
 is the stdout of the script itself, which is most probably yer
 tty.  that means, if it does happen to be open for R/W (which is
 the case on some systems), `cmd2' would be writing to the screen
 whilst `cmd1' is reading from the keyboard --- i.e., the poor
 confused human luser is ""clearly"" expected to manually echo back
 to the computer what it prints.

 good luck!  ;-)

 upshot:  the FIFO is needed.  and this isn't a shell scripting
          problem per se.

 the FIFO solution is fine.  I've used variations (plural) on
 this approach to extend the Korn (ksh(1)) shell language, by
 providing a co-processing interpreter --- `ksh' sends certain
 predefined commands to the co-process, handling control over
 to the co-process until it indicates processing is complete
 and `ksh' can resume normal processing.  with some thought and
 care to insure signals do something rational, works great for
 adding a scripting language (which is the purpose) cheaply to
 script-less programs (useful when you can't modify the, IMHO,
 buggy program to use, e.g., TCL).

Hi Kevin,

In the past when administering large domains, I've used the DNSTool -
http://www.gormand.com.au/tools/dnstool/guide.html

One custom change I made to this tool was to modify it so that it used a
combination of OpenSSH and sudo for remote commands, file transfers, etc.

This may, or may not be what you're after - I'm presuming that you're
considering writing a tool to do the maintenance of the domains?

    hundred or so computers per domain.  some internal, some external.
    i recently learned lex and yacc and i'm thinking that's the way to go.
    i don't really know perl and i know it's useful but i think i can
    write c faster then perl.

    is this a good idea?

    ps  we're really busy.

obviously as a stupid developer with no real admin experience to speak
of, i'm not qualified to answer this question.  does anyone with real
admin experience have any suggestions here?  the problem sounds really
hard, and i doubt anyone has had to deal with this level of complexity
so there probably aren't any existing tools written.

anyone else have any opinions or experience i could pass on?

  | Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the ""Deleted Items"" folder.
  | 
  | In the root of a hard drive, create a directory "".unwanted"".
  | Then periodically create hard links to every file on the hard
  | drive that does not have hard links.
  | 
  | That way, when someone accidentally does ""rm *"" or whatever,
  | you still have a link under "".unwanted""  [ ... ]

 hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea.

 but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites.

 ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the ""snapshot""
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various ""versioning"" filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... )

 one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.

Couldn't have put it better myself, but that's not going to stop me trying :-) 
The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference
between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard
links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more
the files ""real"" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special
thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you
end up with a broken symbolic link - you can't have a broken hard link (except
of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).

No there doesn't :-) . The Bell labs Unix people implemented hard
links, whereas Bill Joy and co. at Berkeley implemented soft links,
five years later, mainly to get around not being able to do
cross-device hard linking, as I understand it. Soft links are fairly
classic Berkeley hackery (cf. gethostbyname, h_errno, and the
resultant problems implementing mt-safe interfaces); they do what they
were intended for, but break fairly easily, in this case when the
target file was deleted. For a better design for similar ideas, see
the MacOS.

Exactly what rights you would have to the code depends on the contractual
arrangement you have with your client, and I'm betting that that's not at
all cut and dried.

However, I have been in this situation where a client was using code I
developed and then decided that he should own the code. Push never came to
shove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a
vis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of
the code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't
take legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him
that I was right and would most likely win in court.

So much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for
the GPL issues. 

Code compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself
covered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps
not made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which
Microsoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of
your customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever
you like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and
you cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another
service provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR
code under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.

If OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then
distributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified
code must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to
PHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.

The relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when
locate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about
any Linux box - 540 on this box)

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.


Your PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or
in part.

> I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated

Microsoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply
that any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and
it must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?

Only kidding but thats what I would do.

CW

----------------
OK, Here's how to do it [1] ...

While the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken,
beg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and
install the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since
they have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages
will need to be reinstalled.  So:

1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc

	Your /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave

2. rpm -ivh glibc-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel
4. rpm -ivh kernel-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm

This installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You'll be able to boot
in a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At
least those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will
contain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you
need to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to
/etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):

1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm

fixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and
sane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.
Reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.

Thanks guys...

Since this thing will be on a sub 56k dialup, any remote admin will be
strictly of the emergency variety.  I plan to have the server mail me its
logs and stuff regurlarly so I can keep an eye on it but most/all of the
admin will be done locally.

[1] ""it"" being migrate a Hard Disk from an Intel P3/4/celeron box to an AMD
K6-x box.  Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while
the AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or
duron chips).  A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an
i586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.  The
solution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions.

[ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2,John Gay <johngay@eircom.net>,ilug@linux.ie,"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 23:24:30 +0100","A while ago I asked what other packages I should optomize for Pentium. One 
person answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself, so I asked on 
another list and got a few answers, most were ""don't even think about it"" but 
a few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch.

After having a good search around the lfs site, I've decided I'm going to 
give it a whirl. I've got a spare box and loads of free time, so why not ;-)

The lfs site, however warns NOT to use optimizations when compiling GCC or 
GlibC? A quick google found PGCC, a Pentium optimizing patch for GCC, but the 
site does not seem to have been updated in quite some time?

So, my general plan, and I'm taking my time with this:

Partition the hard drive for the lfs set-up with 4 partitions, /, /usr, /var 
and /home.
Install a base Debian system into the /home  partition so I can build the 
rest of the system into the other partitions.
Using Debian, build the initial packages into the / and /usr partitions. I'll 
try to optimize GCC and GlibC in this first stage.
chroot to the / partition and re-build the base packages for shared libs.
strip de-bugging from the binaries and change the boot so the system boot 
from / rather than /home, then move /home to it's proper partition.

All going well, I should now have a full base Linux system running that is 
fully optimized for my PentiumMMX including GCC and GlibC.

Now I can build zlib and then X, again optimizing. And I can follow this with 
the various graphics libs, qt lib and finally KDE.

If all goes well, I will probably repeate this for my Dual system, once I can 
find a match for the slot1 550Mhz PIII Iv'e got.

I might even be tempted to write this up for the site.

Cheers,

	John Gay

why?

or more specifically, what do you mean?  on one hand you can optimise
how gcc is compiled.  all that will do is make it generate the exact
same code just a smidge faster.  and since gcc is such a memory pig,
you'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep

sort of. Squid, and most other good http proxies won't let you connect
to any other destination port other than 443 (by default).  So the sshd 
has to be listening on port 443. PuTTy's proxy support is a bit flaky 
right now, the raw connects are a bit flaky aswell, I can't get them 
to work with certain revisions of IOS becuase they use different prompts
and success strings, gah! I havnt played with the SOCKS proxy support
much yet, but it's there.

If you're trying to SSH through a http proxy, use netcat :)
PuTTy's proxy stuff will take another few weeks to get stable, and
currently it won't send keepalives, so if you go afk expect your 
session to get killed by the proxy.  Netcat send keepalives
which prevent this :)

# 
# call as http_proxy_tunnel host port
#
function http_proxy_tunnel()
{
	mkfifo in.fifo

	( echo CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.1 
          echo HOST: $1:$2
          echo HTTP/1.1
	  echo 
          cat in.fifo ) | nc myproxy 3128 | (read ; read ; nc -lp <localport> > in.fifo )
}


course that assumes you have bash, I use cygwin, but the above should be
doable natively, then again if you have cygwin, use OpenSSH and it's
excellently configurable proxycmd :)

Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and

Yup...  In this case, I had two issues.  1. I mirrored the disk to give to
someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2
processor.  2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I
wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware
related.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...

Oh, I'm doing that too.  This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as
robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit!
I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning
strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a
backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The
admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got
fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible
install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...

please don't reply to messages to send a new topic to ilug.  those of
us using threaded mail clients find that really annoying.

tcpd is host based filtering/auth.  so if the ip is dynamic, you can't
really use it.  however ftp supports user based auth - actually it kind
of requires a user, so just set up an account for that person.

gcc has been as good as or better than pgcc for quite a while. pgcc was 
was written back in the days when gcc splintered due to a perception of 
slow progress on the main branch. A number of Linux distributions wound 
up using egcs, partly derived from the pgcc work as I recall. Happiness 
was restored to the world with gcc 2.95 and later.

 > The bottom line is, Pentiums have better instruction sets than

Not really, no. The only instruction of consequence (to gcc anyway) 
since the i386 was the CMOV introduced with the Pentium Pro. gcc 2.95 
will use that instruction if directed to with -march=pentiumpro and you 
will generally get a few percent improvement out of it. Code compiled 
with that option will fail on Pentium and earlier processors.

> The Pentium also

That's the art of instruction scheduling - rearranging the instructions 
generated by the compiler such that they make best use of the parallel 
(""superscalar"") pipelines present in a modern CPU. gcc 2.95 has a fair 
go at scheduling according to the -mcpu=pentium/pentiumpro option. gcc 
3.1 does a better job, and fine tunes for a few more processors such as 
athlon and athlon-xp. They're in the process of replacing the compiler's 
instruction scheduling with a whole new mechanism that should do an even 
better job, but that's a ways down the road yet in gcc 3.3.

As for the exotic extra instructions sets, gcc 3.1 will make use of SSE 
or SSE2 instructions instead of 387 instructions if you use the 
-mfpmath=sse option and you may see some speed benefit from it, but 
there's a chance you may also see incompatibilities. gcc will still use 
i387 code for missing functionality in the SSE instruction set (double 
precision floats for example).

AFAIK no current gcc will ever use MMX or 3DNOW! instructions though gcc 
3.1 enables user code to explicitly generate these instructions with C 
code. The kernel sometimes uses these instruction sets to get super-fast 
block copies of memory or RAID math but not much else.

> Not sure what improvements the P4 introduce? I think it's mostly just speed 
> improvements rather than any execution changes.

P4 introduced SSE2, a _MUCH_ improved version of SSE and a viable 
replacement for i387 FPU code. SSE supports only single precision floats 
while SSE2 can handle doubles. MMX and SSE shared registers with the FPU 
which hobbles them a bit, but SSE2 has its own large, dedicated register 
file. So far P4 is the only CPU equipped with SSE2. AMD's x86-64 CPUs 
are said to have it as well. Of course x86-64 itself is a whole other 
ball game...

That was my understanding too, but I since fould out that for Linux:

Most programs and libraries by default are compiled with optimizing level 2
(gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled for a specific CPU. On Intel 
platforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don't
wish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to
change the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a 
higher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture.

Therefore:

    export CFLAGS=""-O3 -march=<architecture>"" &&
    CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS

This is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all
platforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific
instructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can't copy this
binary to a lower class CPU and execute it.

So these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations 
that lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems 
the most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by 
even the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel.

I'm still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching 
GCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try 
using icc, Intels C compiler. It's known to work with the kernel, but user 
apps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I'm not 
prepared to go to this length.

For QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object 
pre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I'll just have to suck it 
and see. Either way, I'm going to get started building the base today. I'm 
still waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it'll probably been 
several days before I'm ready to build X anyway.

Cheers,

	John Gay

[ILUG] weekend projects...,kevin lyda <kevin@doolin.com>,irish linux users group <ilug@linux.ie>,"Sun, 28 Jul 2002 19:09:29 +0100","two seperate projects this weekend.  first mod_gzip which is an apache
module to speed up serving static and dynamic mime(text/.*) web content.
the second is the compaq smart array configs for linux.

before i go on much more i'll cover the following bits: the server
is running redhat 7.3 linux with all the updates on a compaq dl380.
the client is running the same on a compaq laptop.  pretty much everything
is stock redhat 7.3 - and i'm consciously trying to stick to that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
mod_gzip:
    
    there's a tutorial on linux.ie for it (thanks donnacha) but since i'm
    not an apache person this only got me part of the way.  step by step,
    this is what i did:

	# cd /root
	# wget http://www.remotecommunications.com/apache/mod_gzip/src/1.3.19.1a/mod_gzip.c.gz
	# gunzip mod_gzip.c.gz
	# apxs -ic mod_gzip.c
    
    that should compile and install fine, so add the following to
    your apache configs.  i've included comments to explain where they
    should go.  my apache config is split among many files (which is
    why i didn't use the -a flag to apxs).

	# put this after the last LoadModule line
	LoadModule gzip_module        /usr/lib/apache/mod_gzip.so
	# put this after the last LoadModule line
	AddModule mod_gzip.c
	# this just needs to go below the obove two lines.
	<IfModule mod_gzip.c>
	    mod_gzip_on                         Yes

    finally, poke apache:

	# service httpd reload

    and after you've viewed some pages and check
    /var/log/httpd/compression_log in order to see if it's working.
    if you have /server-info avilable you should see that mod_gzip
    is loaded.  a compressed line and a non-compressed line might look
    like this:

	roo ""/.../ssl_template.head-num-7.gif"" DECLINED:EXCLUDED 0 0 0pct.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
compaq smart array config:   (WARNING: YOU NEED A JVM FOR YOUR BROWSER)

    i searched on google for ""compaq smart array configuration linux"" and
    got a slew of hits.  one of them was a click away from this page:

	http://www.compaq.com/support/files/server/us/download/14703.html

    i downloaded the rpm.  installed it. and ran the server per the
    instructions.  note, the -R enables remote connections.  if you're
    running the browser locally, run it without the -R and connect
    to localhost.

	cpqacuxe -R

    i found that galeon didn't work.  mozilla did.  i suspect it's because
    pop-ups are disabled in galeon config, but i might be wrong.  it uses
    java which is slow and memory hungry on this laptop.  feel free to
    try galeon with pop-ups enabled if you want to.

    so, point mozilla at http://yourserver:2301/ .  login as
    administrator/administrator and change your password.  then go back
    to the main page and click the little drive array graphic towards
    the bottom.  configure your array as you want (i had to add a disk).
    save your changes, and exit.  to stop the server, just do this:

	cpqacuxe -stop

    in my case the drive was now accessible.  i started the process of
    making the file systems by partitioning the drive.  i knew what
    it would be called, but a grep for ida on the output of dmesg
    confirmed it.

	fdisk /dev/ida/c0d1

    and from there i built the filesystems and so on.

hope this helps some folks,

I do not have the time to follow the compiler ""wars"", but I notice that I

GCC 3 should do it, but because it is so ""buggy""[1] it is not worth trying
to use unless you really want to track down those compiler errors... :(

my travels.  first, two style sheets:

    body {
	color : black;
	background-color : white;
    }

http://ie.suberic.net/css/style-windows.css:

	background-image : url(""http://ie.suberic.net/images/use.linux.gif"");
	background-repeat: repeat;

then i include the css in an html page like so:
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"">
    <html>
    <head>
    <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""/css/style.css"">
    <title>blah</title>
    <meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=iso-8859-15"">
    </head>

now i use mod_rewrite to rewrite requests for /css/style.css to
/css/style-windows.css if the browser is on windows by putting this
in httpd.conf:

    RewriteEngine   on
    #RewriteLog     ""/tmp/foo.log""  # use this for debugging
    #RewriteLogLevel        3
    RewriteCond     %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}      Windows
    RewriteRule     ^/css/style\.css$       /css/style-windows.css

oh, and of course images/use.linux.gif is an animated gif that is
transparent for 55 seconds and then displays ""use linux!"" in a large
blue font for 5 seconds.  :)

and the way to create animated gifs is to put each frame in a layer in
the gimp.  pick any name for each layer, but make sure each layer ends
with (XXXms) where XXX is the number of milliseconds the frame displays.
then use the animation tool to export the animation.

2.95 was where the reintegration effort started and work on the other

A lot of those problems seem to have been shaken out by Redhat's ballsy 
gcc 2.96 stunt. I've been trying out RedHat Limbo for a few weeks now, 
equipped with gcc 3.1. I haven't fallen foul of compiler issue so far, 
that I'm aware of anyhow. That said I'm glad I don't do much C++ - seems 
pretty much every version of gcc (2.95, 2.96, 3.0, 3.1, and the 
forthcoming 3.2) breaks C++ binary compatibility in some way or other.

Nice trick.

One thing - to save an image as an animated GIF (for example),
you just do a save as, and set the extension to .gif - you should
get a dialog asking whether you want to merge visible layers or
save as an animation. I believe that you can also specify the
extension as .mpg or .mpeg if you've got the mpeg plug-in built.

Cheers,
Dave.

diary.codemonkey.org.uk [Dave Jones]:
 Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs 
version of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a 
few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the 
kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 
(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due 
to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended 
compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs 
start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some 
of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about 
(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, 
it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined 
but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare 
for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup 
particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large 
parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance 
made large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.

that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the
kernel :(

(Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think
they eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...

This might appear as a very strange email. Maybe it is ;)

I'm french, and I'm currently studying in a engineer school in France,
called UTBM (http://www.utbm.fr). Next year, from February to July, I have
to do a practice somewhere in the world (in France or elsewhere).

I'm a Linux user and developer since a couple of years now (I coordinate the
KOS project, http://kos.enix.org). That's why I'm looking for a practice in
which I can use Linux and/or develop Linux/BSD Software. I also prefer
working in a small company (< 100 people). But since I've never been to
Ireland (that's why I want to discover this country), and since I have no
contact there, it is very difficult to find companies.

So, I thought that the local Linux community maybe was able to help me by
giving some list of companies that are known to work with Linux/BSD or any
other free software.

Thank you very much for your help

I was talking in terms of the actual firewall. If the company in
question knows plenty about Linux and nothing about FreeBSD, I'd go
with a Linux box, merely because when something goes wrong (that
isn't got to do with ipfw/ipchains/ipfilter), then someone knows how
to fix it.

As I said before, I have little to no in-depth experience with
netfilter, I'm aware of it's basic capabilities and had a quick look
at it's features in early 2.4 editions but that's it.

ah doh! yes.

i thought the firewalling code on all the BSDs was fairly related -
sorry. So FreeBSD's ipfw is not encumbered in the same way the old
OBSD firewalling was?

to an extent, i guess so, yes. but i've a few boxes with reasonable 
uptimes that run netfilter/iptables. (i've one that has crashed twice 
now after 60+ day uptimes. but that doesnt seem to be netfilter).

course, there's a lot more that can go wrong with a firewall than the
firewall code. in that case get 2 boxes and heartbeat them.

indeed. couldnt agree more.

(that's the nice thing about *nix - fact we /can/ have nit-picking 
arguments about which *nix and firewall code is better).

i've no experience of ipfw. (closest i've come is looking at IPFilter 
for IRIX - but it had a problem in that it wasnt maintained 
anymore. however, while the englishy syntax is nice, i dont think 
iptables command <args> syntax is a big obstacle).

anyway.. there's choice. and as i understand it, with the advent of 
netfilter/iptables there's now almost nothing between them from a 
technical POV. (apart from ipfw being in use a lot longer).

You could at the very least setup tcp wrappers and limit it to the dialup

Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE. (-STABLE
is a stable branch of the code that has been rolled into -CURRENT
first. It's basically a major release, that's still a work in
progress)

I don't really judge things by uptimes, it's rather like judging
penis size. People like comparing them, and the larger they are, the
more people are in awe of them, but overly large ones aren't really
practical!

Defiantely. I wouldn't like anyone to accuse me of being a

Well, as someone who's used ipchains quite heavily about two years
ago, I can guarantee you that the learning curve for reading
ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. Of course once
you've memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them
and learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is
about before.

It's not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over
another, but if that's all there is in the difference, and the
learning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know
what I'd prefer, as a beginner.

This is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I've
been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped
on the bandwagon.

ipfw was written specifically for FreeBSD under a bsd license by Luigi
Rizzo, who's one of the FreeBSD whizzes.  All three of the BSD's
packaged IPFilter, which has been around for donkeys years and which has
a slightly different feature set to ipfw.

However, last year the author of IPFilter (Darren Reed) changed the
license on development branches of ipfilter to prohibit redistribution,
although official releases would still be kept under the old license. 
This policy got up the nose of Theo de Raadt (lots of things do, which
is why OpenBSD exists in the first place), so OpenBSD re-invented the
wheel and called their firewall ""pf"", under a full-time BSD license.   

The standard release versions of ipfilter are unencumbered, as always.

I'm not so sure that ipfw2 is really ready for production yet, having
only been mfc'd last wednesday.  It certainly adds some nice syntactic
sugar, and is apparently much faster for certain types of complex
rulesets.  It will be good once it's had some time to settle down a
little.

ipfilter is quite nice, and is my current o/s firewall of choice.  It
has some nice features like the ability to save and restore state so
that connections are persistent across reboots, and its logging is
marginally better organised than ipfw's.  It's also very mature code,
which appeals to the rather conservative tastes of my old age.

Limbo seems to be able to compile its own kernel with its own gcc 3.1. 
That said, I don't want to know what kind of patches Redhat are applying 
to that kernel. The .spec file alone is 128KBytes! One of the patches is 
2.4.19-ac10. Redhat don't seem to have patched Limbo's gcc too heavily.

Hi all,

I have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different

if anyone knows of a way that I can have mail (apart from list
mail, which I have already sorted) which arrives to a certain
e-mail address have the From: header in the reply automatically
set to the address it came to.

For example, say I have a company, and sales@company.com,
info@company.com and tech@company.com arrive in the same mailbox.
I don't want to reply to sales@company.com mails with the From:
set to dave@company.com, I would like the mail to come from
sales@company.com.

Is there any way to do this? Bearing in mind that mail can arrive
with my email in the To or Cc fields (and Bcc?), and it might be
buried in a couple of dozen other recipients...

I don't know Mutt, to be honest, but the KDE mail client ""KMail"" can
do this very neatly - you set up multiple ""Identity"" profiles, each
with a distinct email address (and other things if desired, like a GPG
key and a signature).  You can then set up KMail to use various
identities automatically when replying to messages which match a
particular pattern, or which are in a particular folder, etc.  It's
all very cool, and it works very nicely.

But I still don't know how to do it in Mutt.

 Best thing to do would be to have each of those addresses going to a
different folder, then set your ""from"" address based on the folder you are
in, when replying.

i sort my mail into folders using procmail.  so typically i'm in the
ilug folder for ilug mail, the doolin folder for doolin mail, etc.
so i use folder-hooks to accomplish that.  as an example (i do line
wrapping to keep it less then 80 chars long - spacing is important):

folder-hook . ""my_hdr From: kevin lyda <kevin@ie.suberic.net>;""\
""my_hdr X-GPG-Fingerprint: 9C1D 16F4 11F1 6BD2 933C  048D ACC7 9840 89D0 7646;""\
""set pgp_sign_as=0x89D07646;set signature=~/.signature;""\
""set folder=~/Mail;set record=~/Mail/outbox;set postponed=~/Mail/postponed""
folder-hook /(alphyra|Alphyra/[^.].*) \
""my_hdr From: kevin lyda <kevin@alphyra.com>;my_hdr X-GPG-Fingerprint: ""\
""088E 2BC4 381E 990A 1E0E  1DA0 4D44 99EF 20E6 38A0;""\
""set pgp_sign_as=0x20E638A0;set signature=~/.signature.d/itg.sig;""\
""set folder=~/Mail/Alphyra;set record=~/Mail/Alphyra/outbox;""\
""set postponed=~/Mail/Alphyra/postponed""

you could also do this with send hooks.  i use them to tweak gpg settings:

send-hook .			""unset pgp_autoencrypt;set pgp_autosign""
send-hook (ilug|webdev|social)@linux.ie	\
				""unset pgp_autosign;unset pgp_autoencrypt""

and then i have an include file with all people who have keys.

I would question anything being ready for ""production"" being in
STABLE.

He's kept backwards compatibility with ipfw, which is major plus.

My point about IPFW2 being rolled out into stable was merely an
illustration of the fact that ipfw is indeed not ipfilter, and that
there are no license issues there :)

just keep root as hda, you can change boot all you want, that's
where it will get written when you run lilo from the prompt.
just have a sane lilo.conf (with root=/dev/hda) and use lilo -b
to write to different devices.

Thanks to all who replied.

Are there many from this list going to the LBW?

I am trying to get the thursday and friday off work to get to it.

Looking doubtful as it is very near the start of term. Bloody academic
institutes :-).

it only going to take me about 6 hours or so to get there :-(

Do I get beaten round the head for saying ""floppy""?
Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to
the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can
start dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this
might slow you down by all of 60 seconds.

Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence
to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby
active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is
a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that
basically says ""boot /dev/hda1"" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the
resulting ""bootable image"" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a
bootp and tftp server somewhere....

hth,
Ronan.

That won't work like you want.  You'll end up with a boot loader
on the backup disk that contains the 'physical' location of
the /boot/map file on the main disk.  That won't necessarily
be the same as the backup disk.

I can't think of a right way to do his with LILO.  I've got
a similar seup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk
every night), but I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to
get LILO sorted if I have to do a disk swap.

GRUB should be able to handle this no problem, since it
doesn't record sector numbers like LILO does.  Not much help
for you though...

Sorry, but I couldn't resist, I must say that mails like this really impress
me. coz I have pretty much no Irish at all, although my wee Girl starts
Gaelscoil in September so there hope for me yet :)

Much Respect to the Gaeilgors out there.

Can someone translate this for me? Lost all sense of Irish when moved

Well, I'm hardly a Gaeilgóir, but in general I wouldn't consider
either ability or inability in a language something to be proud
of... maybe it's just me, but I'm not proud that I can't speak
Italian, no more than I'm proud that I can speak French or
English.

Try the following newsgroups - 
Beginners:
news:comp.lang.learn.c-c++

More advanced: 
news:comp.lang.c
news:comp.lang.c++
news:comp.lang.c.moderated

Also, you should keep a bookmark pointing at the comp.lang.c FAQ at 
http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/top.html

For tutorials, the guy who maintains the clc FAQ (Steve Summit)
has a tutorial - http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/notes/top.html
Also you could have a look at the excercises he poses - all
linked from http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/cclass.html

For C++, I would guess that the comp.lang.c++ FAQ is a good place
to start - they're likely to have links to suggested reading
material.

If you're going to do any amount of C programming, you should
think about getting K&R2 (The C programming language, 2nd
edition, by Kernighan and Ritchie), for C++ the equivalent book
is Stroustrup. Although the C++ book is a lot bigger :)

Hope this helps,
Dave.

 Sad, that.

 I felt like that till recently, but now wish that it wasn't rammed down
my throat like worming tablets. If they hadn't, it is very possible I'd be
an Irish speaker.

Going rapidly OT here, but I find it shocking that anybody could be
proud of not knowing something. It's like the tourist on holidays using
that speak-loudly-enough-and-they-will-understand technique or (slightly
less off-topic) the friend or relative who says ""I know nothing
about computers!"" and clearly doesn't intend to learn, and is happy
to let you clean up after them.

I certainly agree that Irish is not taught all that well (or wasn't
when I was in school) but I'd like to be able to relearn it and to
count it as one of my skills.

For C++, guru of the week at

with extra material as Herb Sutters Essential C++ and More Essential C++)
is a good resource. 

Scott Meyers Effective C++, More Effective C++ and Effective STL

Um, my test was to tee to a fifo I didn't read from... resulting in the other
reader hanging around forever.... not realising that never-opened-for-reading
and opened-and-later-closed might be different.  Sensible behaviour has now been

mpeg2enc generates stats during the run, so I give each one an xterm.

A nice followon of this for the obsessive archiver is:

I need to ask a question concerning this issue.

What if I don't want to get rid of the MBR -- it will destroy the OS
on that drive.  How do I remove lilo without the above fdisk

fdisk /mbr will restore a dos MBR.. it'll leave the partitions alone.

linux fdisk and deleting all partitions will actually leave LILO in the
MBR though.

Nice how NT ""repair""s a hard disk by removing other OSs.  Could we call it
that on Linux install disks too?

Yup. It's alt.comp.lang.learn.c-c++ Sorry about that.

I've never used the group, so I can't vouch for it's usefulness.
But a few people I respect a lot direct people there for beginner

 from the Hard Disk Upgrade Mini HOWTO :

8. Prepare LILO to boot the new disk

   (Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this.)

   We're  assuming  that LILO is installed on the hard disk's Master Boot
   Record (MBR); this seems to be the most common configuration. You want
   to  install  LILO  on  what's  presently the second hard disk but will
   become the first hard disk.

   Edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follows:

        disk=/dev/hdb bios=0x80       # Tell LILO to treat the second
                                      # disk as if it were the first
                                      # disk (BIOS ID 0x80).
        boot=/dev/hdb                 # Install LILO on second hard
                                      # disk.
        map=/new-disk/boot/map        # Location of ""map file"".
        install=/new-disk/boot/boot.b # File to copy to hard disk's
                                      # boot sector.
        prompt                        # Have LILO show ""LILO boot:""
                                      # prompt.

The easy way is just to install whatever Microsoft or whatever OS you
have in mind:  It should overwrite the MBR.  Indeed, the problem is
usually _preventing_ this from happening, as Microsoft Corporation's
installers seem to forever be overwriting your MBRs when you least wish
it, without asking your permission.

 I've no idea, but a relevant/useful source of info could
 be the «linux-utf8» e-list:

     http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
     http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/

 whilst the list is nominally about UTF-8/Unicode and Linux,
 it often delves into related areas (such as input methods).

 my (vague!) understanding of the state-of-play is there are
 multiple ways of keyboarding scripts such as ""Chinese"", and
 the choice of method is a mixture of personal preference,
 equipment (e.g. your keyboard), and the tool/application
 in question.

 w.r.t. X11 applications, it seems to boil down to two
 approaches:   one unique to the tool itself (apparently
 `yudit' is famous for this);  or  else using what's called
 an XIM (X Input Method).

  WARNING: I am now guessing quite a bit here, based mostly on
           my interpretation of what I've read whilst lurking,
           and watching a few people keyboarding a Japanese
           script years ago!   *** your mileage will vary! ***

 XIMs generally work as a complex compose frontend.  i.e., you
 build up your character as a series of composes of the root or
 fundamental strokes (""radicals"", I think they are called), and
 then ""commit"" the composite character to the application.
 ( yes, keyboarding these scripts _is_ quite slow, I believe
  a good typist can only do a few characters a minute!
  and I assume using a qwerty keyboard is very painful. )

 some XIMs compose ""in place"", others do it on a special line,
 and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?).
 also, some(/most?) XIMs apparently support a US-ASCII input
 mode as well --- _not_ a general Latin-alphabet input mode,
 which seems to require another TLA, called KBD, and which
 apparently doesn't work when an XIM is also being used? ---
 implying you have to switch back and forth between US-ASCII
 input mode (what us English-speakers would call ""normal""
 keyboarding/typing), and the other input (e.g., Chinese).
 I'm not sure, but I have the impression the switch is often
 a toggle, and something like <Control><CapsLock>.

 many apologies if this is completely wrong or too misleading.

cheers!
	-blf-

p.s.  b.t.w., you almost certainly want to be using a UTF-8
      locale.  if RH 7.3 is the so-called ""limbo"" release,
      then you may quite possibility be using one by default.

Irish is taught badly in schools. But then again so is French. I did 3 years
of French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that's 9 years of
French. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.
As it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. 

The problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages
they can't speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as
an afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more
useful...

I hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being
""forced"" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don't mind
as much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually
perceived as).

Anyway, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)

While I am in Linux, the following message is the output when I
execute fdisk /mbr, even though the drive is in read and write mode:

Unable to open /mbr

The mbr is on a separate drive -- not related to the Linux drive.

I can speak for some Chinese input methods and you can do a hell
of a lot better than a few chars per minute.  For example, the
simplest Chinese IM is Pinyin where you phonetically spell out
each character using the pinyin romanisation rules.  For example,
Zhong Guo (Chinese for China) is entered by typing 'zhong',
then you're prompted with a list of possible matches, with the
most common first in a numbered list, so you hit, say, 2 for
the second in the list, then similarly for 'guo' 3.

You can see, that, regarding keystroke counts, it's not that
much different to English.  However, until you get familiar
with the sorting order in the 'possible match' lists, it can
be a little slow.

Other input methods are more keystroke-efficient, losing the
phonetic simplicity of Pinyin.  Chinese characters are almost
always pronounced as a first-part-second-part, so zhong is
'zh'-'ong'.  One input method assigns single letters to
the possible first and second parts, so 'i' might represent
'zh' as a first part and 'ong' as a second part, so you'd
enter zhong as 'ii' and a digit to choose from the possible
matches.

I think the Microsoft Global IME has a 'stroke' mode where
you can build up a character stroke by stroke, but you'd only
use that when you know the character you want but you don't
know how to pronounce it.

Probably most often Ctrl-Space.  That's what the Microsoft Global
Input Method Editor uses and what xcin uses IIRC.

Regarding the original poster's question - here's what works for me
on Red Hat 7.2

o  Make sure the xcin and ttfonts-zh_CN RPMs are installed.  (The
   fonts might not be essential, I think XFree comes with usuable
   Chinese fonts in the XFree86-fonts RPMs

o  Select Chinese (Simplified) as the language in GDM when logging
   in.

Everything should 'just work'.  If you've got the default clock in
your GNOME panel, you should now see it in Chinese.  A lot of the
menus will also be in Chinese, but you should be able to find your
way around.

Use Ctrl-Space to toggle between Chinese and English input.  When 
in Chinese mode Shift-Space toggles between something that I don't
understand, but it blocks exiting to English.  So if you can't use
Ctrl-Space to get back to English, try hitting Shift-Space, Ctrl-Space.

Fire up a GNOME terminal.  In Chinese mode, type zhong 1 guo 1 and 
you'll see the Chinese for China.

Getting this to work while selecting English at the GDM screen is left
as an exercise for the reader.  Looking at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/xinput
and /usr/share/doc/xcin should give enough info.

Later,
Kenn

Should it be 38K4 - a fairly common baudrate for serial port
connections? Though if you are getting this much, the baudrate
may be right. It looks like high ASCII so it may also be worth
playing with the tty type (ANSI/VT etc).

 There is no canonical test, and the information is not necessarily
 available. If you check out how struct stat is defined on your system,
 you'll find that only

     time_t   st_atime;    /* Time of last access */
     time_t   st_mtime;    /* Time of last data modification */
     time_t   st_ctime;    /* Time of last file status change */
                           /* Times measured in seconds since */
                           /* 00:00:00 UTC, Jan. 1, 1970 */

 are available. File status change = i-node status change, it includes
 creation, mode change, ownership change etc., so this is what you want
 only if the file status wasn't changed since creation.

 This information is also shown by ls -lc, but parsing ls' output requires
 a bit of effort. I'd rather recommend to write a short C program to access
 the file status directly, and output the ctime directly (seconds since
 the epoch, i.e. perfect for numerical comparison).

 (Another way is to use GNU find -printf with a custom format:
  ...
            %c   File's last  status  change  time  in  the  format
               returned by the C `ctime' function.
 ...)

[ILUG] Strange ssh problem,Niall O Broin <niall@linux.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Thu, 01 Aug 2002 15:51:12 +0100","I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh.
Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This
works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our
external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries
to ssh anywhere he's asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don't
they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys
but that didn't help. 

I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred's .ssh
directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a
password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into
the agent).

In case there was something else in Alfred' environment, I copied .??* from
alfred's home directory to alfio's, remembering to change ownership
afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.

We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is below

debug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: input_userauth_pk_ok: pkalg ssh-dss blen 434 lastkey 0x80916f0 hint -1
debug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method publickey

and before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfio said:

1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)

whereas with alfred the same segment of the debug log went

debug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /nfshome/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password

and before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfred said:

1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)


This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he
logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home
directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don't have any
problems.

Subject: [ILUG] Dell GX260 V Redhat 7.3


Hi,
We just got some new Dell GX260 machines here are work and I'm supposed to
be putting Linux on them. I tried installing RedHat 7.3. It just didn't want
to know about the graphics card. I's an onboard Intel DVMT chip. No
dedicated memory, it takes it from the onboard RAM.

I was wondering if anybody had gotton these machines and had any luck
getting this graphics card working?

When this graphics card didn't work, I installed a PCI Diamond Stealth 64
VRAM card. Xconfigurator auto-detected this and my 21"" SUN monitor no
problem but whenever it tries to test the configuration it fails and the
screen is left with a blue background and all of the text is blue.
Does anybody have any idea what the problem is or how to fix it?
Cheers,
deccy.

The onboard DVMT card has an Intel 845 G/GL chipset.
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/linux/ or
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/intel845g/linux.htm has more specific
information. There is help available there.

I also found somewhere (not through personal experience though) that
2.4.19-pre10ac2 includes drivers for the chipset ?

The onboard DVMT card has an Intel 845 G/GL chipset.
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/linux/ or
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/intel845g/linux.htm has more specific
information. There is help available there.

I also found somewhere (not through personal experience though) that
2.4.19-pre10ac2 includes drivers for the chipset ?

 Buying any new machine is going to cause problems with a six month old
set of drivers. Same happens in windows - you have to go get your drivers.

 Yes, dell use the most recent stuff they can, to save money. That's not a
bad thing. Just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of
the box.

Hi,

I've installed Quake 3 onto my computer and it starts to run up ok but as
soon as the graphics start it bails out.  It complains that there is an
error in sis_drv.o,  the line before this says that it is starting Quake in
24 bit depth, now from http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsis630.shtml I
understand that the sis630 won't do 24 bit depth.  So is there a way to make
Quake start up in 16 bit depth?  I've done some ""google""ing but drawn a
blank.....

	It's still quite easy to find out, pre-purchase, what components if
any are going to give you problems with a specific distribution/version.
With Dell just check the support.dell.com site, match the system, look for
downloadable drivers. From these if there aren't any linux drivers you can
usually find out the chipset of each device. Plug them into google with
""linux"" and see what people have to say about them. Generally speaking when
you buy the system you'll be told the make/model of each device rather than
the chipset, so further investigation is necessary.

	The cavaet, of course, is always to know exactly what you're buying.
In most people's cases unfortunately it's not the person who bought the
systems that will be configuring them.

When I get a box I don't want any of that integrated chipset crap 
whether its for winblows or linux. Its just like IBM (mwave dsp chip ?)
(shared video/main memory ?)in the old days. I know you can flip a 
mboard jumper switch to turn crap off and install your own cards 
but why bother ?

To clarify my point is this ....
Dell makes excellent machines and I would recomend their machines and 
their aftersales support over any other manufacturer that I can think of.
However if you want that box for linux and you have a life and you dont
want to spend a week of it fucking arround and googling to get that box
working properly be damned sure you do your research before you buy it.
And this especially applies to their budget machines.

And this isn't taking a swing at you John but ...

A lot of the time the reason that you encounter this is cause someone has 
such a box and they say to you ""hey can you install that linux code that I
got
from the guy in the internet cafe"" :-) and you say sure and you go to their
house 
(without a net connection/56k modem). And the machine has got this crap

""well I didn't expect much from something thats free anyhow""

Absolutely, to buy a machine and hope later that linux will take to it is
beyond naive. There is a lot of support, mailing lists, web sites, etc that
will help people decide if Linux is going to like a box or not, use them.

There *IS* a Dell/Redhat alliance. It lead to a shocking amount of Dell
systems being easily configurable with RHL.

You make it sound that incompatibility has been deliberately built into the
new systems. The products that any company sell with linux installed will be
easily reinstalled with linux. The products sold with Windows only may not
be. Having said that I've never found a Dell system it was impossible to put
RH on. I have had one or two headaches in the past doing it, though.

Hmm. Check to see what colour-depth your X session is running in. Try
changing DefaultDepth to 16 (in /etc/X11/XF86Cnfig-4), and restarting X.
Letting us know what distro you're using would help too.

Where does cron log to? (check /etc/syslog.conf) 

Usually it's something like /var/log/cron.log or /var/log/cron 

Anyways have a look in the logs, make sure your backup ran (so long
as there weren't any errors).

Typically if there's any output from the commands you've run,
they're mailed to you.

Thanks!

In the past I tried ""lilo -u /dev/hda"" and it wouldn't work -- an
original copy of the MBR must be in /boot directory for it to work. 
Which is exactly what I didn't have.  The installation of Linux
Mandrake didn't afford me that luxury.

Also, I'm glad you cleared up the fdisk issue.  I know better now --
previously I was under the impression that fdisk had a hidden switch. 
This is obviously not the case.

How about xcin?

This is an example of an XIM approach that Brian mentioned. hint shift-space 
get you back to typing in english.

The speed you can type at will be very dependent on how well you know the 
input method and in some cases how well you know how to construct chinese 
characters.

I have seen people using electronic pen and tablet devices to just write the 
characters in, though that was windows.

Conor - it's a rather large continent - people might need to know where you
are going to suggest sources. And if you're buying abroad, make sure you get
to test it - many places won't have facilities for you to do that.

Any monitor should just work - they all have VGA connectors and any half
decent brand will be know about by XFree setup programs in modern
distributions. However, if you have the budget (insurance paying for the
dead monitor, perhaps ? - and WHERE was your monitor that it got caught in a
flood ?) getting a monitor with a DVI input is best. Of course, you'll need
a DVI out video card then, too. DVI provides a much better picture than VGA
because it removes the analog stage - basically DVI gives you a direct
connection from video ram pixels to monitor pixels - the best pictures I've
ever seen on a computer is on my notebook screen at 1400x1050 (which doesn't
use DVI, but an internal connection which has the same effect). Brand wise,
I like Iiyama a lot and I think they may have a Europe wide warranty.

I just wanted to second what Stephen says, from an independent
perspective:  The few times I've encountered an obstacle installing
current Linux distributions on Dell boxes, it's been because Dell were
an early adopter of (e.g.) a new Adaptec SCSI chipset, which hadn't 
been included in all installation kernels.  And that is the risk you
_always_ take when you blindly buy hardware systems for Linux without
verifying chipset support, first.  If anything, Dell have over the years
occasioned less such trouble than have many competitors, in this area.

If your card has its own MesaGL drivers it may want you to remove the one in 
the Quake directory (certainly NVidia cards do this). Have a look at the docs 
for your card's Linux drivers.

Hisax is one of the ISDN modules : doesn't apply at all in this

I guess that requires something more in the way of budget then...  Given
that this monitor was serving as the single monitor for 4 boxen (via a
4-way vga KVM switch), I'd be looking at investing in 4 DVI cards along
with another KVM to suit while a VGA version _should_ just plug into
place.

If this is new behaviour in a previously working network, what did you do to it?

  Test the cables by switching which machine has which.
  Test the hub ports by switching cables around.
  Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are.
  Test the network card... by replacing the thing!

Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139
based card costs less than 20 euro.  The design is a couple of generations later
- more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the
card and it's PCI.

The program has different behaviour depending on the value of

here's a simple example...

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

long int add(long int a, long int b)

long int subtract(long int a, long int b)

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  long int a, b; /* Operands */
  long int (*operation)(long int a, long int b);
  char *progname, *marker;

  if(argc != 3)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Usage: %s [int1] [int2]\n"", argv[0]);
    exit(1);
  }

  progname = strrchr(argv[0], '/');
  if(progname == NULL)
    progname = argv[0];
  else
    progname ++; /* Skip past the '/' */
  
  if(strcmp(progname, ""add"") == 0)
  {
    operation = add;
  }
  else if (strcmp(progname, subtract) == 0)
  {
    operation = subtract;
  }
  else
  {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Program called with invalid ""
            ""name %s. Quitting.\n"", argv[0]);
    exit(1);
  }

  a = strtol(argv[1], &marker, 0); /* Use base 16 for args
                                    * starting 0x, and base 8 for

  if(*marker != '\0')
  {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Invalid character %c in argument %s.\n"",
            *marker, argv[1]);
    exit(1);
  }

  b = strtol(argv[2], &marker, 0); /* Use base 16 for args
                                    * starting 0x, and base 8 for

  if(*marker != '\0')
  {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Invalid character %c in argument %s.\n"",
            *marker, argv[2]);
    exit(1);
  }
  
  printf(""%ld %c %ld = %ld\n"",

          b, 
          operation(a, b));
          
  return 0;
}

Say that's in operation.c, compile it using 

gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -W -O2 -o add operation.c
and then 
ln add subtract
and run both, with appropriate arguments.

There's a switch statement in the program on argv[0].

It's not including any options in the link.

[ILUG] 3c509 & 2.4.19 problems,Albert White <albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Sun, 04 Aug 2002 13:14:27 +0100","Hi folks,

I decided to upgrade the kernel on a machine at home from 2.2.18pre21 to the latest from kernel.org which is 2.4.19.

However I have encountered one problem, my network card now dosent work, well kind of dosent work...

Instead of one eth0 on IRQ 10 I now get:
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x220, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a 3e 0e 48, IRQ 5.
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: 3c509.c:1.18 12Mar2001 becker@scyld.com
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.html
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth1: 3c5x9 at 0x300, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a be 0e 48, IRQ 10.
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: 3c509.c:1.18 12Mar2001 becker@scyld.com
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.html

This results in the interface(s) coming up but while packets can go out they can not come in.

I've tried not loading the 3c509 mdule on bootup and then `modload 3c509 IRQ=10` bit it still gets loaded as above, on IRQ 5 and 10. On 2.2 it loads to IRQ 10.

Anyone got any suggestions on what to do here? Its a debian 3.0 distro. This works fine when booted to 2.2 so the hardware/BIOS etc seem ok, so it seems to be 2.4 spacific. Have I missed some kernel setting?

Cheers,

I have been unable to get the 3c509 to work with 2.4.19 with an IRQ of
10 which works in 2.2.x okay. Can you use anyother irq for it.

As Kevin said, the problem can reputedly be solved using Donald Becker's 
Linux-native utilities for the 3C5X9 series.  Turn off PnP, and then set 
the IRQ and I/O base address as required.  Make sure those are also
made available in the motherboard BIOS Setup program to ""Legacy ISA
devices"" or whatever it's called, there.

(1) Quibble:  For values of ""work"" limited to X11, not console support.

(2) Decent substitute graphics cards with well-tested XFree86 support
are cheap.  Swap the problematic one out, and save it for some other
workstation later.  For that matter, somebody with a Win32 system
containing such a card might be ecstatic over the opportunity to swap.

Well, why not try Linux on Sparc. It works pretty well and I have not had
major issues with it. There are minor problems: like the serial console
drivers, but for workstation installs I suspect it will work fine.

And you get a working version of your favourite KDE/Gnome desktop instead of
DTE, uhm, I mean CDE.

> Basically the whole installation procedure is

Well, you have to add the workstation to the install server first.

Talking of which, you can install Sparc Linux using this technique as well.
The image takes a while to load, but once this is done you can install in
the normal fashion.

SuSe for Sparc works fine. I am using Debian because the Sun boxen I have
subverted do not have graphics consoles. It also just works.

If you have a spare workstation, I am sure I could burn a couple of CD's for
you. (If I can find them.)

 I've just been re-aquainted with the Jumpstart stuff after a long
absence.

 There is a nice need 'add_install_client' script that you feed the
archtecture, ethernet address & ip to, and it'll setup everything from
RARP to Bootparams for you. Very simple.

 This script takes a -d option, to boot via DHCP also. On the negative
side, Sun's terminal handling leaves a lot to be desired - it won't work
properly on a Wyse 120+ for instance, no matter what emulation mode the
Wyse is trying to do.

 To do PC netbooting properly, you need an motherbard with a PXE BIOS.
Then you are flying.

 Heh, how hard would it be to get a PC with an OpenBoot prom ?

sorry, i missed this.  redhat supplies something similar called kickstart

OR a network card with a BootRom installed, and BIOS support to boot of the 
network.

You could burn a PROM yourself, if you'd wish. I believe that the netboot 
project would have a PROM you could download and burn, having the needed 
h/w of course.. ;)

 But the PROMs are for specific network cards, and all their are really is
a bootp/tftp client. Not the whole set of nice bits & pieces you get with
an OpenBoot PROM.

 AMD were talking of supporting it ages back, when the Athlon was looking
like it would just be on workstations from day one. They seemed to drop
it, and go for the crappy MSDOS compatible BIOS though.

Thanks for the replies. It turns out that it was an IRQ conflict with an old 
sound card.

Despite checking the BIOS and running the 3c509 setup utility on 
http://www.scyld.com/diag, the 2.4 kernel still picked a card on IRQ 5 and 10.

It works fine now that the sound card is removed, but I'm still confused as to 
why this worked in 2.2.18 but not 2.4.19, seems like a regression to me...

Strange.

I had the double IRQ problem with the 3c509 combo, 
and turning pnp off in the card's firware fixed it.

As far as I remember the problem I was having was 
that the driver was assigning an IRQ to the card's
 RJ45 port and then another IRQ to it's BNC port,
 and then referenced the card via the second assigned irq,
 and turning off PnP in the card's firmware fixed that.

You must be having a different error
Else
PnP is still turned on.
<<Obvious suggestion entails>>
Making sure the IRQ and io space you assign
the card in it's firmware is not in use by
any other ISA devices.

True, but would still enable you to do a network install without using boot 
floppies. Then again, boot floppies are cheaper, and easier to recreate 
when you'd like to do some changes to it. Gets messier when you'd have a 
boot image on a server, and the only way you can test it is to boot it over 
the network. In any case, it's just one option available.

Too bad they didn't go with that then. Would have been so much nicer than 
the old MSDOS crap. I do like the OpenBoot idea actually. Especially being 
able to set the PROM to boot from whatever disk slice you'd want. No need 
to set that in lilo/grub any more in that case, since the OpenBoot rom 
takes care of that part for you. Then again, you wouldn't get a menu that 
allows you to choose what you want to boot. There's good and bad, all 
depending on what you want to do, I suppose. Sitting here and typing I'm 
realising that it is both a nice thing, and a nasty thing..

Ah well, life sucks as well, some say.. ;)

Of course then there's http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/ for

Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the 
interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can 
specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home, and 
come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning?

I don't see why this should be a _major problem. The prom (ie the ""ok"" prompt) 
is almost at the hardware level and hence dosent depend on the os so you 
should be able to connect to that easily enough. Once the machine is installed 
cant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after all 
(sorry couldn't resist!)

hmm... I'm not familiar with wyse stuff, but I only need to use the console 
when something breaks, then anything capable of something basic like vt100 at 
9600 8n1 seems to work  . Not sure why you'd need to worry about this much 
really, just set up jumpstart to install automatically then you don't need to 
look at the console at all.

it's been a while since i did a kickstart install.  my memory is that
you put a file on a standard redhat boot disk that essentially scripts
the install.  there are a slew of options - you can have it fetch it's
install script from a tftpd server for instance (similar to jumpstart),
or it can all be on the floppy.

I have no clue about ffs but...

In the 2.4 kernel source Documentation/Configure.help there are various kernel 
options CONFIG_JFF* that enable it.

http://developer.axis.com/software/jffs/ and http://sources.redhat.com/jffs2/ 
are the URLs cited in that documentation. They have links to mailing lists and 
archives which may be able to answer more specific questions.

If you mean Amiga ffs, then thats selectable in the kernel config also :)

Is this to mount an OS-X partition?
The following would be of interest in that case:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101198676827824&w=2

summary is you should be able to mount FFS readonly,
and the config item probably UFS:

[padraig@pixelbeat ~]$ grep UFS /boot/config-2.4.18-3
CONFIG_UFS_FS=m
# CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE is not set

So `modprobe ufs` should work on a standard RH7.3 install?

Yeah yeah yeah. I tried it (over a year ago) and it sucked like a new vacuum
cleaner. Although I expect that it will be a lot better by now. What I would
really like to see is Gnome on one of the Sun Ray thin terminals.

Er, I mean normal fashion for a Linux install. This would be distro
specific, anyway.

I am sure it would be possible to do an automated install with a few script
changes. I would not be surprised if Debian does this already.

I do know that if you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are
picked up by silo. So:
  boot disk linux

would not prompt for selection but would boot straight through. From there
it is a matter of tftp'ing the correct config file and the install would be
automatic from there on.

The problem is that the time between linux booting and when the console tty
drivers are started can be a black hole, without error messages or log in
prompts. The other problem is that sometimes Linux will drop in to the PROM
on shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting. Without a serial cable or
keyboard it is not possible to reboot the box without flicking the power
switch hidden at the back of the case.

I think if the console is ttya/ttyS0 it will drop into PROM. If it is
/dev/null then you do not get console messages but the box will shut down
properly.

In short yes. The more logic involved the longer
the CPU is executing it. I.E. there is more logic
executed (including NIC logic) when going down
to the metal than when using lo. So how much
logic is involved for each type of IPC (why
are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are
mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...). Anyway the
best IPC method to choose is dictated by the data
you want to communicate between the processes,
as the various IPC mechanisms are tuned for
various data types.

IBM are running a series comparing doze and Linux IPC mechanisms.
The socket (which references the others at the bottom) is here:
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-rt6/?t=gr,Redhat=Sockets

The following in google gave useful info also:

Well, when studying engineering the rule of thumb was that infinity was 10

Therefore I believe in infinite stack.

Oh goodie. My final year project rears its head :-)

Much as I would like to answer an unqualified ""yes"", I must admit: if 
you already code in a style that makes heavy use of GOTOs, coding in the 
same style with GOSUBs or function calls does not improve code. Much the 
same as when the manuals on ""modular coding"" said to write modules that 
would fit on a single sheet of computer paper, lots of coders proceeded 
to split their code into arbitrary 60-line chunks. :)

However, ""Go-to considered harmful"" points out that to analyse (==debug) 
code, you need to be able to tell what the point of execution is, and 
what the values of the variables are at that point. This is an easy(tm) 
job if the code uses assignment, if(), for() and functions, but not if 
it uses GOTO. (See http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF 
for the full letter).

Despite being one of Dijkstra's brain-damaged children who learned BASIC 
at an early age :) I never use GOTO anymore (or any of its bastard 
offspring like break, continue, fudged function calls with sleight of 
hand in the variables). My code is longer than it might be if I had used 
GOTO at a critical, handy point. However, code is a bit like networks - 
you always end up adding bits on where you didn't expect to - and the 
benefit is felt when another person (like myself but in three months 
time) is modifying or debugging it and doesn't have to go through the 
hassle of dealing with the impact of the GOTO.

Of course you can create write-only code in any language.

 Yes. Especially in the languages he was talking about - C, Pascal and
Assembler. Goto's can be used well; there are a few used in the kernel
code to improve efficency. They are almost required in some languages
(like C) where 'break' or 'continue' can't be told how many loops/switches
to break out of.

 But, in general, goto's make a mess of code.

 Recursion is only truely useful if you have an infinite stack. People
that think they have an infinite stack shouldn't be let near a compiler.

I worked on a testharness for (wait for it) petrol pumps some years ago,
little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest
environment to track crashing bugs under) master which logged its
piteous whinings. I inherited the dos part of it and worked mostly on
creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my
predecessor's ""add new entries to the end of its linked list"" function
recursively called itself with each following link until the terminating
one showed up. Of course it died miserably when it ran out of stack. I'm
sure he felt he'd done a good days work when he planted that bomb for
me.

if used properly, they actually can make code more readable.  but those
proper occasions are quite rare really.  it's a good idea to avoid them
since over use of goto will create what niall calls ""write-only code.""

[ILUG] Cobalt question,"""John P. Looney"" <valen@tuatha.org>",ilug@linux.ie,"Thu, 08 Aug 2002 11:31:01 +0100"," Try this little problem on for size:

 I've installed Redhat 7.3 on a raq3's disk. But fscked if I can get the
kernel in /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-3 to boot. It's insisting pulling the
kernel from ... somewhere else. The old cobalt kernel.

 I've booted the disk with a redhat rescue CD, and installed grub on the
MBR and hda1 & hda2 (just in case). No luck. The cobalt BIOS says ""Booting
default method - From disk"".

 Any ideas how I can get this thing to boot *my* kernel ? Anyone care to
guess how the cobalt boot process ? Google seems very quiet on the
subject of the cobalt boot process, and what is there doesn't seem to
work. Simple stuff like:

 (how to boot a different kernel)

Interesting. I've always wondered about things 'considered' to be bad. 
Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?

Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto 
or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of 
programming syntax
to make sure people use loops or recursion?
<<To iterate is human, to recurse divine>>

Kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be 'good'.
For example people bang on about polymorphism, but is there actually any advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance?

Hmm.

I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.

 Yes. Especially in the languages he was talking about - C, Pascal and
Assembler. Goto's can be used well; there are a few used in the kernel
code to improve efficency. They are almost required in some languages
(like C) where 'break' or 'continue' can't be told how many loops/switches
to break out of.

 But, in general, goto's make a mess of code.

 Recursion is only truely useful if you have an infinite stack. People
that think they have an infinite stack shouldn't be let near a compiler.

There's a more simple reason as to why strlen shouldn't be used on
the string here, and that's because in future you could actually
change the contents of ``somestring'' within the for loop, and be
left wondering why the number of iterations are not as you expect.

Unfortunately strlen is a relatively expensive operation. If you are using
C++ this is not such a big issue as string.length() can be declared const.
So long as you do not modify the string object, the compiler can do the
caching for you.

I do not think this is possible in C, though?

You could write the same code fragment as:
============================
for(a=0,l=strlen(somestring);a<l;a++)
{
    some_thing_goes_here();
    if(b==l-4)
        do_something();
}
============================

Note my previous point: if some_thing_goes_here() or do_something() are very
long functions, then there is no real need to optimise this code.

Also, for string manipulation, a much better approach would be:
============================
char c;
char* p;
for(p=somestring,(c=*p)!=0;p++)
{
    some_thing_goes_here();
    if(*(p+4)==0)
        do_something();
}
============================

This works because C used \0 terminated strings. It improves performance
because you always have a pointer to the character instead of having to do
array manipulation. Strictly speaking, the variable c is not required as
most compilers are smart enough to store *p in a register.

The problem is that this uses pointer arithmetic, which can make the code
illegable if not managed carefully. Which is one of the reasons I prefer
Java for most programming tasks. :)

Yes and I understand that argument, however.
Sometimes I find that if I don't try to write code in the least space
possible or for example become lazy and say

If(q==true)

a=some_function();
if(a) <--which apparently works but is 'bad coding style'.

That's what I mean about letting the programming tools take care
of the coding.... it's considered 'bad' apparently.

Or for example say you are writing a loop that says

For(a=0;a<strlen(somestring);a++)
{
 some_thing_goes_here();

 if(b=strlen(somestring)-4)
	do_something;

};

when I probably should say

c=strlen(somestring);

For(a=0;a<c;a++)
{
 some_thing_goes_here();

 if(b=c)
	do_something;

};

Of course 'people' always say that the extra call to strlen() will make no
difference on the machines we have 'these days'.

But my machine has 256mb of ram.... not 640k.

Since have done thanks, unfortunately Eircom 
have a severe case of 'selective hearing'. It 
seems that customer comments are only appreciated 
when they are positive. When I was complaining
they also decided that I wasn't a paying 
subscription customer but an Indigo GoFree one 
and that if I didn't use Windows that there was 
obviously something wrong with me (I mean who's
ever heard of Linux?).

True, I apologise for that. It was just the way
in which Eircom (didn't) deal with the ORBS problem.

You could also change your e-mail to a more responsible provider. If Eircom
are not up to scratch, then use somebody else and make sure you let Eircom
know why you think they are so useless. You can still keep your old e-mail
address if you have to.

<mild rant>
This is something that often annoys me. Programmers can spend hours inlining
code and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance. The best
performance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm.

Most function calls get made very rarely. Optimising them often makes no
sense, produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms.

Inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small -
such as string manipulation routines. But these are a small part of most
applications.

One example I frequently see is people optimising a database function call.
Most database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of
instruction cycles. Trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost
saving of, say, 5 seconds in 20 hours.

But a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline
optimisations can turn that same 20 hours into 10 minutes.

</mild rant>

 I'd prefer to use an ISP that didn't tolerate spammers myself.

 The only way Spam lists work is because ISP's customers find they can't
send mail to many domains, and ask the ISP to do something about it.

 Most likely. But, seeing as I've flashed the thing with the most
up-to-date BIOS I could get (with all the screaming 'experimental' stuff
you usually see), and no luck.

 Next trick is to format /boot as ext2, and try again.

Oops, I tend to feel like that most times! I tend to feel that if we

Is this something along the same line as ORBS?
I remember not so long ago when eircom was put
on the ORBS list, half the ISP's in Europe wouldn't
accept mail from my address. Of course, informing
Eircom of this did nothing for about 4 months or so.

IMHO stopping spammers is a great idea but I'd rather
have to hit d or delete rather than have my messages
bounced by someone else's ISP.

[ILUG] Dialup on debian,Dave Wilson <dave.wilson@heanet.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Thu, 08 Aug 2002 23:57:48 +0100","Hi all,

I have a debian machine with an external ISDN terminal adapter, which 
I'm trying to get to dial a Cisco 3600 running CHAP. wvdial on Red Hat 
copes fine with this. However, I get the same results if i use pon or 
wvdial on Debian: pppd negotiation is detected, pppd is started -- and 
I'm never assigned an IP address.

Looking at the logs on the Cisco, I see that in place of the username I 
seem to be transmitting a six-digit hex number. e.g.:

Aug  8 23:35:00.311 UTC+1: %ISDN-6-CONNECT: Interface Serial0/0:19 is 
now connected to <phonenum> 19eb85

The last entry should be my dialup username. (Substitute incoming phone 
number for <phonenum>).

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

Yup I'm running it on my k6 233 laptop. It's tres sweet.

I would recommend getting wvdial, opening a virtual terminal dialing the internet and then emerging the packages you need.

I did my install over my home lan and the lan in work (which has DSL - running Linux as firewall/router/mailserver of course).

But yes you will need at least wvdial to make this puppy happen me thinks.

In fact it looks as if the base install comes with wvdial for just this kind of instal.

But I just found this on the Gentoo site for you.
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=4691&highlight=modem

Specifically

If it is not too obvious, these are the steps I took.


    * Boot off the install CD

    * setserial (if needed)
    * create mount point for other distribution
    * mount other distribution
    * chroot'd to other distribution
    * su - to regular user
    * ran wvdial
    * switch consoles and install as normal


And yes I do give better technical support to people who use
distros I like.

 Burnt the ISO's from the latest Linux Format magazine. Took a couple of

modem and the installation gives you the network card setup so internet 
download is out of the question, but, I installed the Stage3 tarball which

 What actually happens is that if, for example, I attempt to install the KDE

well, smtp being store and forward, what is an smtp proxy? :) that's

probably, the most effective way to stop spam in the long-term is to 
configure your email server to use the SPEWS blacklist and a good open

SPEWS: to force ISPs to take action against spammers 

SPEWS /will/ list entire ISP netblocks /if/ the ISP consistently

I suppose it is - however, nobody knows that

With a newsgroup structure, this is obvious.

Nope, can't say that I had any problems installing SuSE 8.0. Just stuck in

[ILUG] cdrecord + 2.4.19 = hard-lock,Michael Conry <michael.conry@ucd.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Sat, 10 Aug 2002 01:58:45 +0100","Hi all,
I've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wondering
if anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it.

I am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system.
I have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and the
scsi over ide kernel modules.  I was running kernel 2.4.18 until
probably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out.  Downloaded patch
and installed new kernel with no real problems.  This morning I went to
burn a CDROM, and the system locked hard.  Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowed
cdburning to work fine.

This problem is very reproducible (on my system at least).
the cdrecord command I was using was
    cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso
The blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it just
locks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even).  AFAICS,
the system just stops.  Hard reset is only way back in, and when it does
reboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messages
/var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate).
cdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (my
cdr drive and my cdrw).
The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.

I tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was a
kernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it gives
the same error.  I also downloaded and compiled the source for
cdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i was
wondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used
which maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted.

Anyway, I'm completely stumped.  Google searching has not done me much
good, and I'm a little bit lost.  What I'd like to know is
a)  How to fix the problem ;-)
b)  Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem?  The severity
    of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm
    not very knowledgeable on these things.
c)  Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list? If
    this is an appropriate course of action, are there any tips (beyond
    the guidelines on kernel.org)?

Like I said, I'm lost on this one, so any info is very gratefully
received.

Thanks for that.  I'd sort of suspected that if it was a widespread
problem it would have already been fixed.  Starting to look more likely
it is a mistake/misconfiguration on my part, though I still don't know
where to look for the mistake/misconfiguration.

The impression I get from reading lkml the odd time is
that IDE has gone downhill since Andre Hedrick was 
effectively removed as maintainer. Martin Dalecki seems
to have been unable to further development without 
much breakage. However, this is part of the fun of
the development kernel. Alan and others are annoyed
because they can't do any development themselves while
IDE is broken. Hopefully the 2.4 IDE port should help.

You don't use break? What about case statement blocks, or leaving a for

 See, the IDE subsystem is like the One Ring. It's kludginess, due to
having to support hundreds of dodgy chipsets & drives means that it is
inherintly evil. A few months of looking at the code can turn you sour.
Years of looking at it will turn you into an arsehole.

 They haven't found a hobbit that can code, so mortal humans have to
suffice.

however, how do you add features? eg tagged commands, udma100, 133, 
etc.. serial ATA, new chipsets. plus the IDE code might be fine, but 
lots of drives and chips have bugs, which need working around.

all that said, Linus says he does his development on an IDE machine
and hasnt had any problems.

You'll probably want to buy a retail boxed set, e.g., via mail order.
The only editions of SuSE for i386 that are lawful to duplicate and
redistribute are as follows:

SuSE Evaluation:  This is a single-CD ISO9660 image, currently at v. 7.0. 
If you don't mind having only one disk's worth of SuSE, and being
several revisions behind the boxed-set editions, this is quite good and 
recommended.

SuSE Live Eval:  Another CD image, currently at v. 8.0, but this one
doesn't install to hard drives at all:  It's a demo disk.

SuSE FTP Edition (for lack of an official name):  Not a CD image, but
the contents of ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/current/ .  You would
have to mirror the ftp directory tree, and then figure out how to
install (e.g., over NFS).  Currently at v. 8.0.

There are three (non-redistributable) boxed-set editions, at different
price points.

I'm assuming in the above that you're talking about an i386-architecture
computer.  Slightly different answers apply for Alpha, IA64, SPARC, PPC,
SPARC64, PPC64, or S390.

I apologise for wasting your time.

I follow this list from home, and thus use
a yahoo account. I haven't been able to find
a threading mechanism for this, plus the
fact that the list can start to fill up
my inbox after about a week of no pruning.

This is the reason for my initial grumbling. I 
would like to be able to follow what's going

Anyway, I should have initiated a new thread for my

Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other
than put up the ftp version, but surely they
can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy and
giving it to me?

What is the GPL all about then?

But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not
theirs to BSD!

Nobody can oblige them to give away anything
other than ftp - I'm not asking for that. I'm
asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to
burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange
for a reasonable consideration (say, the price of
the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a couple of
pints?).


What does the GPL mean now?


I don't want their 60 days of free email support
or anything similar (if I did, I would pay for
it).

Not everything on the SuSE CDs is GPL-ed.  IIRC, YAST
has a more ""proprietary"" license.  There may be other
third-party commercial products on there as well, which
cannot be freely copied under the GPL.

> What is the GPL all about then?

(1) I'm sure you are not _actually_ under the delusion that everything
on a typical Linux distribution issued subject to the terms of the GNU
GPL.  For one thing, it seems difficult to imagine you _not_ being aware
that XFree86 is under the X/MIT licence, that Perl is under the Perl
Artistic Licence, that Apache is under the Apache licence, and that
numerous BSD utilities are under the BSD licence.

Furthermore, xv, Acrobat Reader, pine, pico, Netscape Communicator, and
a whole slew of other applications typically included aren't under any
open source licence at all, but rather are proprietary.

(2) You seem, in any event, to be under a misconception as to what the
GPL provides, as to code under its umbrella.  It says (in part) that
_if_ you have lawfully received a copy of covered binary code, then you
may insist on one of certain forms of access to the matching source
code.  Please note that it does _not_ guarantee you any rights
whatsoever if nobody's decided to give you a lawful copy.

> But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not theirs to BSD!

Again, you seem to be under a misconception.  If you check, I'm quite
confident you'll see that SuSE are in full compliance with GPL v. 2's
source-code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their
distribution.  And no, nobody has the legal right to alter licence terms
to someone else's copyrighted property.  But you have not cited any
reasons to believe that SuSE have done any of those things.

See below.  You and the CD owner would be committing copyright violation.
SuSE Linux AG are rather unlikely to knock down your door and haul you
down to a judge, if that's what you're asking.

You appear confused between Linux the kernel (which is a copyrighted
work to which source code access is guaranteed under the GNU GPL if
you've received a lawful copy of a binary version) and the rather
imprecise concept of a ""Linux distribution"", which is a number of works
under diverse licence terms collected onto some media.

In the case of SuSE's boxed sets -- which are NOT lawful to duplicate
and redistribute in their entirety -- at least a couple of the
applications on them (YaST, YaST2, and the installer program) are
proprietary copyrighted works of SuSE Linux AG.  In the general case,
duplicating and redistributing CD-ROMs containing those works is
copyright infringement.  Illegal.  No amount of hand-waving about the
GNU GPL is going to change that.

(SuSE permit people to duplicate and redistribute the ""evaluation"" and
""live-eval"" CD editions, despite that fact, as long as it is not ""for
value"".)

If you want to have a SuSE boxed set to install from, buy one.

> What does the GPL mean now?

Suggestion:  Read it.  I would guess you've not yet done so.

Indeed.

The ftp'able tree (e.g., 8.0 for i386) contains to my knowledge only
items whose licences allow public redistribution, even where they aren't
open source.  The retail boxed sets (Personal Edition, Professional
Edition, and Enterprise Edition) _add_ a number of additional
proprietary apps that are very much _not_ freely redistributable.
I made a list, a while back:

Freely redistributable proprietary apps in SuSE
----------------------------------------------
UofW pine/pico/pilot
John Bradley's xv graphics tool
T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars's xforms/xformsd graphics toolkit
(some others)  

NON-freely redistributable apps (in boxed sets):
-----------------------------------------------
Siemens AG's DB4Web middleware
Poet Software Corp. FastObjects SDK for Java and C++
IBM Java 2
Intel-v92ham winmodem driver
MainConcept GmbH's MainActor video-editing package
www.mimer.com's MimerSQL
MGE UPS Systems's Personal Solution Pac (MGE power management software)
Real Networks's RealPlayer
Adobe Acrobat Reader
Software AG's ADABAS D
H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH's AntiVir V
Knox Sofware Comm.'s Arkeia
Datan's dataplore digital-signal analysis package
Enterprise Solution Server (ESS) ERP system
Sun Microsystems Java2
Borland Kylix Open Edition
Moneydance
OpenEIS enterprise information system
Opera Software's Opera browser
Heisch Automatisierungstechnik's rk512 serial interface to Simatic S5 /
    S7 plcs
SAP database
Sun Microsystems Star Office
VMware, Inc's VMware
http://www.vshop.org/'s vshop e-commerce software for MySQL
  

All of the latter category either are available only via retail sale, or
are available lawfully on the public Internet only from authorised
distribution sites or on CDs from authorised distributors.  The exact
terms differ.

For example, you can download Borland Kylix Open Edition from
borland.com, free of charge -- but you'll notice there's no mention of
any right to redistribute.  That right is reserved by default to the
copyright owners, and Borland doesn't include it in the Kylix
proprietary licence.

Good point, I didn't think of that. However, that doesn't help with a
case statement, which IMHO is cleaner than using an if statement if you
have a lot of branches... but then again maybe that should be refactored
away with polymorphism :)

Well, you should consider 'break' inside a 'select' statement
to be part of the syntax, rather than a control flow modifier.

A _mandatory_ part of the syntax, at that.

I honestly don't know.  I made that list a long time ago, and certainly
didn't re-research it before posting it today.  So, I offer three
candidate explanations:

1.  I muffed that part, the first time, and was talking through my hat.
2.  SAP had a proprietary version licensed to SuSE at the time.
3.  SAP still have one licensed to SuSE today.

I'm not sure which applies.  #1 is certainly a good possibility.

Why? When it comes down to the assembly level, it gets turned
into some kind of jump instruction. Should I pretend I don't know
this when I'm programming?

It's not mandatory. You can leave out the break, and the flow
of control will continue to the next case. Which can be useful
in certain circumstances.

Failing that, I have the 7 CD's from Woody (Debian 3.0).

I've not seen any claim from SuSE of copyright over the distribution 
as a whole.  (That would be a ""compilation copyright"", to use the legal
term.)  But they definitely assert (and in fact own) copyright over
YaST, YaST2, and the associated installer program.

So, if one wanted to distribute a version of SuSE free of encumbrances
from SuSE Linux AG, one would merely have to write a replacement
installer and do without YaST/YaST2 (and probably a few other things
they wrote).  A Simple Matter of Programming.

Let's limit the discussion to x86, to simplify.  There are some
additional complications for some of the other architectures.
(Essentially, they make most of the other architectures' ISO images
available gratis, because they aren't selling boxed sets and want the
public to have them anyway.  The ISOs include third-party proprietary
apps, but of necessity not the highly-restricted ones available in 
boxed set editions.)

(1) You can get a single-disk ISO9660 image of SuSE ""evaluation""
edition, version 7.0, _lots_ of places, including here:

ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/evaluation-7.0/evaluation-7.0.iso

(2) You could ""wget -r"" (or equivalent) the entire 8.0 FTP Edition (for
lack of an official name for it) from here (or mirror sites):

ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/

Please note the restricted rights granted for use of the SuSE-originated
YaST program specifically, stated here:

ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/COPYRIGHT.yast

A grant of limited redistribution rights to the distribution as a whole 
(apparently covering the FTP Edition and the Evaluation Edition) is
stated here: ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/README.mirror-policy   Quoting:

     please make sure that you meet the following conditions if
     you intend to mirror ftp.suse.com:

   - SuSE Linux (YaST in particular) may not be reproduced on
     CDs or other media FOR VALUE. Reproduction for personal
     or educational use is explicitly allowed and encouraged.

> I'm not sure on the details of it, but I think SuSE have
> probably done an OpenBSD of the cd they sell?

OpenBSD Foundation assert a compilation copyright over the OpenBSD
official ISO9660 image.  A compilation copyright is the copyright
monopoly that, for example, the editor of a set of third-party short
stories receives.  Even though he didn't write any of the constituent
stories, he put creative work into selecting, arranging, and editing
those stories.  The law recognises such efforts as creative works
deserving copyright protection, if there is sufficient creative effort.
(A judge would decide, if someone made a court case of it.)  Courts have
held, on the other hand, that arrangement and publication of
alphabetical telephone listings in a ""yellow pages"" telephone directory
(the advertising section) don't have anywhere near enough creative
content to support an overreaching telco's claim of compilation
copyright.  (The court politely said ""Nice try"", in effect.)

The OpenBSD Foundation's claim may be a bit of a legal bluff, too.
Theoretically, one could get around it by creating a slightly different
set of ISO9660 images, thereby finessing the claim of compilation
copyright.  But nobody bothers, because OpenBSD Foundation actually 
charges only a very reasonable price for jewel-case sets, and nobody
wants to endure the barrage of hatemail from Theo & co.

I've never seen any claim from SuSE of compilation copyright on its ISOs
or distribution as a whole.

Again, the ""FTP Edition"" and the Evaluation Edition may be redistributed
more-or-less freely, as long as it's not ""for value"".  (Ditto the
""live-eval"" edition, which is a demo only.)  The three boxed sets'
contents may not.

Looking at http://www.sapdb.org/history.htm , it seems that SAP went
open-source some time in 2000, so my information likely was correct
at the time I compiled that list.

In addition, please note that, just because a company decides to go open
source with a codebase as of some new release version, that doesn't make
all versions ever released open source retroactively.  A licence
attaches to a _copy_ of a creative work.  So, if there was a
proprietary, non-redistributable copy in SuSE boxed sets, it's still
proprietary and non-redistributable -- unless SAP AG decided to mail out
a separate permission grant for it.

Yes, you're confused.

A Linux distribution (_any_ Linux distribution) contains lots and lots
of separate codebases.  Some are under the GNU GPL.  Many are not.  Are
you clear on this point, now?  This is my second try.  One suspects that
you actually understand perfectly, but just don't like it.

You're further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to
get covered software for free.  It does not.  It provides that _if_
you've lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have
rights to also receive the matching source code.

Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's contents, the only way
you can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay
the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not ""lend"" or duplicate) 
you his copy.

> Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend with 7.3 pro, so

Ask him _what_?  If you're asking him to ""lend"" or duplicate his CDs,
then you'll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally.

Don't like SuSE's product licensing?  Write your own distribution.  You
can even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_.  All you have to do is 
heed the licensing terms on the individual pieces.

What, you think that's too much work?  Then, try a different
distribution.  Clue:  _Not_ one packaged in a retail boxed set.  Even RH
7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on
the Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among
others.  (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other
hand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether 
open source or not.)

How unimaginably difficult is this to do?
There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right?
Right.

Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure 
in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other), 
no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places
 such a suggestion would stumble.
Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring
 a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging.

That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox.

Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun.

Just a pseudo random thought.

Indeed - that I actually had understood prior
to all this - for example commercial entities
with trial/limited/crippled editions. 

Which is no problem - I don't see why that should
be a problem for SuSE though - surely the

One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't 
understand was that SuSE had proprietary 
extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow
people to use under the GPL or even under  a
FreeBSD style licence.


I thought that the model for the likes of 
SuSE was selling support and customisation, 
rather than what I thought of as the core
""product"". I thought that the likes of Yast
came under core - maybe it worked in the glory
days before, say, 2001 - I can understand that

All I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under
the impression that for *_those_* all one
needed was to pay for the media and not for the
code itself?

Ai-je tort?

My understanding was that binaries or whatever
could be received for the cost of the media plus
a token of one's appreciation (the latter being
subject to agreement between the parties) - I was
offering a bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two
and a chat for a copy - I don't know what the going
rate is.


If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a
different issue, and one for which I would be
willing to pay.

I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll
end up doing that!

Seems to me to go against the spirit of

I have now realised this, thanks to your kind
explanations. I can borrow them, but not 
copy them? That's fine - IMHO, it goes against
the spirit of the GPL though.

And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence
terms on, say, trials for commercial company x
to which I object, it is the way SuSE appears, 
at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have
mixed up proprietary and open stuff.

The GPL makes no stipulations about charging for binaries.
In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU's /bin/true,
compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary
for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you
just might get away with it!)

However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must 
provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might
buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell
that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I'll need to provide
the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just
might make money at this, since there might be a market of
10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of
getting a binary.

But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for
1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite
/bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of
the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is.

You see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost
(or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any
business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_
charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be
providing some value for that money, or you'll go out of
business faster than a dot-com in 2001.

And there are real ways to provide this value for money
(convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a
friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates,
convenience of having what lots of other people have,
posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading
over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from
a ""real"" company, etc).

There will be segments of the market that will pay various
amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't.
Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the
source will always be free (or minimal cost).

Later,
Kenn

I know that, too.

However, the discussion was tending towards
""don't use things like goto and break to alter flow of control
in your program"".  While not valid 100% of the time, it's a 
reasonable rule of thumb.  The idea is that, when looking at
code, it's easier to see how control moves through a 
function if your basic control blocks do all the work.  The
specific example of replacing a break in a while loop with
a modified while() expression shows this.  You only have to
look in one place to see when you'll run off the end of the
loop, not hunt through the whole loop.  (Although that particular
example wasn't really that good, since the extra test was 
adding on (... || done) and setting done = true in the loop.
Which is much the same as a break really.)

The idea is to surprise the next programmer as little as 
possible when he sees the code.

In a similar vein, having a break in every case of a select
block makes the flow much clearer.  Flow goes in, zero or 
one case blocks are executed and flows comes out the bottom.
Leaving out break statements breaks this assumption.

My point is that, while there are a few situations where it
makes sense to leave out the breaks, I usually tend to 
consider the break at the end of each case more like the
brace at the end of the while block.  

In fact, maybe it wouldn't have been a bad idea if the language
was designed such that the continue statement meant fall through
and break wasn't needed:

   select (x) {
      case 1:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
      case 2:
         /* do something - falls through to next case*/
         continue;
      case 3:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
      default:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
   }

Still, hindsight and all that.  Sigh.

Kenn

the rhetoric.

Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):

Anything either you or I have to say about their motivation is
speculation.  Bearing that disclaimer in mind, here's mine:  They make
money from selling boxed sets.  They're glad to make some versions
available for almost-unrestricted distribution (not ""for value"") via CD
duplication or the Internet that they estimate won't substitute for
boxed-set sales.

For example, they _could_ have packaged what I call the ""FTP edition"" 
in ISO9660 images.  The fact that they didn't suggests to me that they
see the inconvenience of mirroring FTP Edition i386 files (which, at the
moment, are v. 8.0) as motivation for all but the really determined to
buy boxed sets, instead.  

Likewise, they _could_ release a v. 8.0 (current) version of the
""evaluation"" single-disk ISO image.  Instead, they always keep it
several versions behind.  This again seems like an incentive to buy a
boxed set, after ""evaluating"" SuSE via the ISO image.

Again, the above is my speculation (only) about their motivations.  All
we know of a certainty is what permissions they've granted, which are a
bit messy and complex, but nonetheless quite clear.

Those permissions, as a reminder, apply to the SuSE-produced components,
YaST, YaST2, the distribution installer program, and possibly other
utilities that I don't know of.  _They_ wrote that code, and have every
right to grant or withhold permissions as suit them best.

Hmm, let's slow down, here:  There's a persistent misconception that
it's possible to place somebody else's work under a new licence without
his permission.  Not so.  There is nothing in copyright law that would
make that possible.

The copyright _owner_ has inherent rights in his (e.g., software) work,
and is entitled to issue as many _instances_ of his code under diverse
licences as he wishes.  (If he gives you a copy with no licence
statement, there's effectively a default licence by operation of
copyright law.  To avoid going into a long digression, let me just say
that it's a proprietary licence by default.  That's why, in order to
have open source software at all, there must be an explicit licence
from the copyright holder.)

No Linux distribution _ever_ entails relicensing people's software
without their explicit permission -- since no such relicensing can occur
at all. 
 
You cannot get away with taking SuSE Linux AG's work and redistributing
it under what you claim to be a BSD licence, or the GPL, or anything at
all other than what the copyright owner has specified, because you
simply lack the right to do so.  Claiming to do it would be copyright
violation.

If Stallman and friends at the GPL (let alone Linus Torvalds and kernel
contributors) had intended to prohibit putting GPLed works on the same
CDs as proprietary ones, and selling the result only via retail stores
(plus mail order, etc.) in shrink-wrapped boxes, I'm 100% certain they
could and would have done so.

Guess what?  They did not.  They didn't even require that anybody give
you copies of the GPLed components, ever, at all.  All they did was
require that _if_ you received GPLed software lawfully, then you had to 
be able to get matching source code for a limited period, upon request.

Spirit of the GPL, you say?  I'd suggest that Stallman and company knew
exactly what they were doing, and that the degree of access to GPLed
software is exactly what they had in mind.

Mais si.

You are indeed under a misconception, and may want to read the text of
the GPL to verify this fact.  The GPL does _not_ entitle you to a copy
of any binary software.  Section 2 provides for rights to access to
matching source code _if_ you have lawfully received a copy of a covered
binary.  That section provides three alternative mechanisms for the
distributor to provide such access.  And SuSE _do_ actually provide 
exactly that access.

Or so I think to be the case.  If you believe there's some GPLed
codebase that you can lawfully receive from SuSE whose matching source
code they are not making available exactly as required, please tell us
which codebase that is.  (That would be SuSE Linux AG's headache, not
any of ours, but it might be interesting to examine.)

Your understanding is almost correct, but not quite.  (1) The access
provisions of the GPL concern access to _source code_, not binaries.
(2) It kicks in _only_ for people who've lawfully received covered
binaries.  (3) _Covered_ software means instances of codebases actually
placed under the GNU GPL by their copyright owners.  The mere act of 
placing a piece of software on a CD-ROM with GPLed software doesn't GPL
it.

In fact, the assertion to the contrary is a favourite FUD tactic from
enemies of Linux:  They're forever trying to convince software producers
that using GPLed software in any way with their proprietary offerings
will ""taint"" their copyrights and force them to put their property under
the GPL.  It's simply not so.

That's nice, but they're not _offering_ the exact contents of the boxed
sets free of charge and lawful to duplicate & redistribute, or ""borrow"".
For one thing, as you will have noticed from my earlier listing of
components, the boxed sets' CD-ROMs include quite a lot of _third-party_
proprietary software.  SuSE Linux AG _cannot_ allow you (or your friend)
to hand out copies of that software freely, because it's not theirs in
the first place.
 
> I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll end up doing that!

If you mean the 3-CD core set of RH 7.3, good.  It's a quite decent
distribution.  But bear in mind that the RH 7.3 boxed sets include
some other third-party applications whose owners would be very upset to
find them being copied or ""borrowed"". 

> I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can
> borrow them, but not copy them? 

No.

Look, it's a collection of software, many elements of which may not be
lawfully just given out to multiple people:  Your friend installing it,
then _not_ erasing it but merely letting you ""borrow"" the CDs results in
the product being installed in multiple places.  That's unauthorised
copying.

Well, if you don't like SuSE, then you probably won't like Caldera
eDesk, Xandros Desktop, Lycoris Deskop LX, Libranet, Lindows, or KRUD,
either.  Depending on your criteria, you also might not like Red Hat,
Linux-Mandrake, or Yellow Dog, since all of those have boxed-set retail
sets that include CD-ROMs that may not be publicly redistributed.
 
(I don't even use SuSE.  I'm just trying to clarify the licensing
question.)

It shouldn't be too hard.  Red Hat, for example, ships with everything
you need to build a modified distribution.  And it's all GPL (or free
enough).

There was talk of this in the past.  Taking a regular distribution like
Red Hat or Debian and tweaking it for Ireland - things like translations,
ISP setups, default bookmarks.

Never took off.

Why not try it yourself.

 Ah, you see - cobalt's don't use lilo. They have an openboot-like prom
that looks in an ext2 partition in /dev/hda1 for a file called
/boot/vmlinux.gz - nothing else.

 The only way I think you can set parameters is with a ""set_params"" line.

 However, when I run 
    set_params root=/dev/hda2
 and then run:
    bfd /boot/vmlinux.gz

 It boots the old kernel, I assume from the prom. It seems to do this, if
something goes wrong - no error, just boots the default kernel.

 BTW, 'bfd' means 'boot from disk'.

 Indeed. Personally, I think it's the sort of reprehensible behavior that
split Unix way-back-when into the mess it was in a few years back, before
Linux...got rid of most of them.

 Vendors wrote their own wierd-ass installers & config tools to lock
people to their OS, they added all sorts of functionality that was not
availible to other OSes to make themselves different from the competition
(Motif on non-free OSes, incompatible filesystems etc).

 While a good idea when you share code & standards, in an environment
where you do neither, the user suffers.

 Antefacto Embedded Linux...did.

 Nice little distro that'd run on a 64MB flash card (with 12MB free), with
a read-only root filesystem. Perfect for little embedded systems. It was a
very cut down version of RedHat 7.2.

 Must see can we release the build system & everything. That was the
interesting bit. Distros, in general, are a waste of time. You've no idea
how much better something like Debian or RedHat could be than something
you did yourself, unless you picked a niche area.

AFAIK it isn't hard at all to create
your own modified version of the redhat
distro.  There's even a tarball[1] with this
specifically in mind.  The people who built
the Ximian version of RedHat used a system
similar to said tarball.

Building a distro which uses a *BSD ports
system rather than rpm, deb or whatever
would complicate things a tad more IMHO.

It *is* a good idea though.  I've been 
wondering about the same thing for a couple
of months now but always considered it too
complicated to carry out. (If that makes any
sense at all).

I don't discount any other work like for 
example Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe
there is general interest in an Irish distro.
Anyone?

How unimaginably difficult is this to do?
There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right?
Right.

Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure 
in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other), 
no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places
 such a suggestion would stumble.
Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring
 a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging.

That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox.

Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun.

Just a pseudo random thought.

 This is actually a raq3. Though, I do have an old raq2 that Liam was
helping me get netbsd on (about all you'll get on a 16MB machine these
days).

 Anyway, I wussed out, and copied hda1:/ to hda2:/boot and set the bootfs
to be hda2. It worked, though it's mounting an ext3fs as ext2. But I'm
getting there.

 Yep.

 Power on the box while pushing the recessed button near the LCD with a
paper clip. On the serial console, you'll see ""press space to enter the
prom"".

 It's a crap prom, but a prom, nonetheless.

 That isn't the problem - I've flashed the raq3 with the 2.3.40 PROM, a

I think the words you are looking for are ""competitive advantage"" or
""differentiation"".

Since most Linux vendors are businesses, they need to make money to
survive[1]. To make money they need to sell products. To ensure they sell
their product, they must provide something that other vendors do not.

The down side is that this produces many variations of the same product. The
benefit of open source is that there is a common standard which everyone can
share. (The up side is that the competition drives the different
organisations to constantly improve their product offering[2].)

So unlike SunOS vs AIX vs HPUX vs Tru64, where the API's and available
functionality were often starkly different, Linux distributions are mostly
the same.

While I may have to look in /var/named on Red Hat, and /etc/bind on Debian,
the binaries are basically the same, as are the man pages. In most cases,
doing a ""man named"" will reveal the compiled location of the config files.
So long as this is understood, it is easy enough to administer most Linux
distributions.

I expect that as companies and public sector organisations begin to
understand the open source paradigm, you will find even more distributions
appearing. The reason I believe this is that deriving a new distribution
from, say, Debian requires comparatively little effort. I would see this
requiring slightly more effort than the amount of time many enterprise
admins spend trying to customise the desktops, screen savers and software
distribution mechanisms of their own organisations.

IMHO, as always...


- Matthew

[1] Depending on your world view, this may be rephrased as ""they need to
make oodles of profits and screw the little man to survive."" This discussion
is beyond the scope of this list. :)

[2] The often overlooked problem with competition is that it weakens the
""combatants"", leaving the field open for a less powerful force to take over
and entrench its position (in this case I would be referring to Microsoft).
However, I do not believe this will effect the Linux movement as all the
vendors are obliged to work together to a great degree, thanks to the GPL.

Where ports==FreeBSD like and portage==Gentoo style, perhaps some would

I have my own thoughts on this, and would be very keen to create yet another
new (and different) distro.

Of course, it would require a minimum of EUR300,000 in funding, which is the
reason I have not started this project myself... :(

Not sure Motif is a good example, really. When Mozilla was going through its
""Let's Use Motif/Let's Not"" phase, Jamie Zawinski mentioned in passing that the
installed base of Motif-bearing systems kicked the installed base of
Linux-bearing systems into a huddled ball. Something, perhaps, to do with the
fact that every
Sun/Solaris box since version mumble shipped with it, plus every HP/UX box,
and
for all I know every other mainstream proprietary Linux. Motif was more a
unifier across Unix subspecies than a differentiator.

Now, filenames longer than 14 characters, maybe, or the options for ps (are we
sysv or bsd?), or the whole /dev tree, or the libc implementation...

Sounds like you are talking about setting up a company, to be a vendor....
I'd venture the early days of Debian, Slackware and other involveds there
was no such financing.

[ILUG] Irish Copyright Law: some analyses,Waider <waider@waider.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Tue, 13 Aug 2002 10:59:55 +0100","Two interesting analyses of the Irish implementation of copyright as led by, as
best I can tell, anticipation of the EUCD (since the Irish law was passed in
2000, and the EUCD is somewhat more recent than that). The pieces of interest
are the papers by Prof. Robert Clark, who perhaps might not be a bad choice of
speaker for some future LUG gathering. One of the more eye-opening comments in
the second of his papers is that Irish legislation is, in effect, more
draconian than the DMCA.

http://www.cai.ie/Past%20Events.html#2002

There are some other interesting pieces here, too, for anyone concerned about
copyright and the like in Ireland.

Cheers,
Waider. Props to Danny at NTK (www.ntk.net) for the link.

Have you tried gconf-editor? It's a GUI front-end to gconf
settings (and metacity has it's settings handled by gconf, like
all good gnome2 apps). It's true there's no designated metacity
configurator - but the whole point of metacity is to have
reasonable defaults, and thus get away from the need for settings
altogether, and have the window manager be not in the way (as so
many are).

As to the sawfish issue, no idea, sorry - are you sure that
gnome2's panel handles 1.4 applets at all?

 Don't buy it.

 shift-alt-s should start a shell, alt-d should maximise a window
vertically, alt-q should close a window, alt-w should shade it. These I've
used for about eight years, and I'm not about to change them now.

 Stuff like alt-1 to go to workspace-1, I love - it just appeared in
windowmaker about six years back, and I've also gotten used to it.

 Wierdly, I've gone back to sawfish & gnome 1.4 - and the keybindings
still don't work. It's not fair.

Well, yes, if I were to add all the frilly pink bits and the crunchy
chocolate flavoured pieces... :)

Seriously, I can only see two reasons to start another distro: you have
something fundamentally different to offer, or you are customising an
existing distro for an unusual and specific situation. Between
Mandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover
most day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are
already covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.)

Therefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to
spend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing
alternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier
maintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a
company to be behind such an initiative.

I imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one
week[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of
packages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested
on most hardware variations, and voila, a ""new"" distie. :)

 Well, this mostly worked, despite Colm saying that ""you want the

 It likely means that I was just lucky I put the failed-disk directive
after the raid-disk one :)

 Any ideas why ?

 My suspicion is that I've a lack of knowledge about how initrd works, so
I'm not sure it's loading it. For a start, the / filesystem is being
mounted as ext2, at first, not ext3. It does seem mounted as ext3 after
the fsck is done - but that means that it's mounted as ext2 read only,
fsck'ed and then remounted ext3. Losing the point of it.

 Given I can't pass the kernel parameters (I think), how then can I get it
to load the initrd ?

So I suppose you could setup half of the raid1, copy your partitions across,
vi lilo to append the new device labels, /dev/md0 instead of /dev/hda...
re-run lilo, then raidhotadd /dev/xxx /dev/md0 [or is that the other way
around?]

I have never tried this so this could be bollix, I have setup root-raid
systems but during install time, I have had drive failures on my

IMHO linux software raid is extremely good.

 I've a running system, and I want to set it up so that the disks are

 However, the RAID_HOWTO just mentions RAID 1 and RAID 0 on a machine

In order to autodetect soft RAID volumes at boot, you need to set the

that was before my time.  all unix systems i've used didn't allow hard
links to directories, or if they did they were restricted to root.
the reason why is because you could cause infinite loops in the kernel -
usually a bad place for infinite loops.

to make them consistent with hard links.

let's call these super-soft-links.  ln -ss

    % ln -ss foo bar
    % ls -i foo
    111 foo
    % mv floyd foo
    % ls -i foo
    222 foo

and now bar no longer points to foo.

    % ln -ss foo bar
    % ls -i foo
    111 foo
    % rm foo
    % touch floyd
    % ls -i floyd
    111 floyd

the fs would need to maintain a table of links going the other direction.
so when the move command unlinks foo in the first example, it could
check the table and mark that bar is now disconnected.  the same would
be true for the second example - and even more important since bar points
to floyd if no table is consulted.

and this all fails to handle nfs mounted file systems or filesystems
that have dynamic inodes (the fat fs's and reiser lacks inodes i think).

To explain what I mean:
According to the PGCC site, GCC by itself is not very good at taking 
advantage of the pipelining features introduced with the Pentium family. The 
PGCC patches are supposed to make GCC generate tighter code, but your point 
about compiler bugs is well taken. This is why I am taking things slow and 
looking into these things. As Isaid, the PGCC site does not seem to have been 
updated in at least a year or more?!? I am also looking into GCC itself. Now 
that the 3.1. series is out, it might be better than when the PGCC patches 
were written. The bottom line is, Pentiums have better instruction sets than 
the original 386 instructions that they still support. The Pentium also 
started introducing pipelining so properly generated code can be upto 30% 
faster than equivulent code that performs the same function! As for why 
optimise GCC if it will only produce that same code only slightly faster? The 
speed is based on a percentage of the total compile time. The first time I 
compiled the qt libs, with only 16M and a LOT of swap, it took over 48 hours. 
I've now got 128M in the box but at 200Mhz any increase, distributed over 
such a long compile is still considerable.

My understanding, and I've followed the development of the Intel family since 
the 8080, each generation since the 386 has introduced better and faster 
instructions. I.E.:
The 486 introduced I.E.E.E floating point instructions by incorporating an 
FPU on board. The first few generations were flaky, so Intel disabled the 
dodgy ones and sold then as 486SX, I.E. without the FPU. Later generations 
were better, this is why you only find slow 486SX's ;-) Therefore 486's, with 
working FPU's can calculate floats faster than 386's, but you must generate 
the proper codes to take advantage of this.

The Pentium's improved the FPU logic and introduced pipelining. The first 
generations of Pentiums had faulty FPu logic programmed into them, the 
Pentium Bug, but subsequent ones were fine. These added instructions are 
faster again then the 486 equivulents. Also, the pipelining needs careful 
instruction ordering to take full advantage of it's speed improvements, 
again, something the compiler must know about to utilise to full effect. 
According the the PGCC site GCC does this poorly, but that info seems to be 
dated, GCC3.1.x might be better. This is one of the areas I am researching 
closely to get an answer.

MMX added the ability to perform matrix calculations on int's with single 
instructions and using special DMA features within the Pentium to speed this 
up. Two problems with this:
1) int's are not very useful for most matrix calculations, floats would be 
betters.
2) this is not something that can be optimised well by a compiler. It need to 
be identified and provided for in the sources.
I.E. not much use to anyone, but makes great ad copy ;-)

The PentiumPro improved the pipeline enormously. Again, a properly written 
compiler should be able to optimise for this, once it can organise the code 
properly.

The PIII added MMX-type instructions for floats! Now this IS useful! 
Graphic-Intensive programs can take greate advantage of this, but it must be 
provided for in the source code. Compilers can not, usually optimise for this 
sort of thing. XFree86 and DRI are two prime examples that do provide for 
this, so the PIII can run XFree86 and DRI quite a bit faster, IF it's 
compiled for these SSE instructions!

Not sure what improvements the P4 introduce? I think it's mostly just speed 
improvements rather than any execution changes.

So, The difference between the 386 and the PentiumMMX 'should' yield a 
significant speed boost if optimised correctly. There are faster floating 
point instructions and pipelining that need optimising for. I'm not sure if 
GCC can optimise properly for the pipelining, at least the PGCC group found 
significant improvements to add to GCC2.95.3 to gain speed improvements of 
upto 30%. 30% of 48 hours is 14.4 hours. Of course none of this will have any 
effect on O/I bound processes but GUI's are mostly CPU bound. I am also 
finding out about object pre-linking optimisations which should give even 
better performance for QT and KDE.

Now if I had another PIII for my box, I could take advantage of those SSE 
instructions to optimise XFree86 as well!

> kevin

An, of course, I've loads of time on my hands now and I need something to

Subject: [ILUG] Backup solutions


Hi folks,
I maintain a colocated server on behalf of a small group of individuals,
and am looking at backup solutions. Is it possible to get some sort of low-
end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. 40
Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra cost
but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost.

What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device,
then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the
last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible?
I'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as part
of the charge for colocation is rackspace.

Thanks,
Ciaran.

As far as I know, there are ide add-in cards that support hot-plugging of
drives, not too sure if this feature is availabe on the cheaper
promise/highpoint controllers, but it is definitely available on the
higher-end (true ide-raid) cards.

Ok

Well I am having fun with ADSL now at the moment. I had gotten the
full package from eircom and elected to take the Zytel Prestige 645M
(that M is very important) But alas I cannot get it to work even with
another Major and popular graphical OS. So after almost 8 hours onto
adsl support trying to conince them that they did actually supplu and
support the 645M and not just the 643 and 645R its still not working.
So, after all that I am going to try a poweredge to connect and if
all else fails I will wait till Eircom send me out a replacement ( I
am going to have to look for the Alcatel this time :-) But while I
was doing my googleing I came acroos this

http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/how-to-connect.txt
http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/

And they look very cool for the beginner. Also the is a cool article
on www.linux.ie about USB and ADSL with PPPoE on Linux. ANyhow when I
do get it working (either with the 645 MMMMM or something else) I
will put up a howto but really the above is quite cool.

I have a dedicated linux server running debian 3.0 with the ADSL modem
plugged directly into it.
I have a 5 port switch connecting the home net, all have their own 10/100 nic.
The server runs my firewall/net gateway/etc.
And I have some firewall rules for masquerading

Once the machine is configured for adsl  (thats the tough bit)
the network stuff is quite easy.

I found that to be the simpelst way to go.

The simplest setup would be to connect a wireless access point to you
hub then use a wireless pcmcia network card in your laptop.  You could
also get some pcmcia to pci adapters or wireless pci network cards for
your desktop machines.

The access point would be configured with a network name (essid) and a
channel number for you wireless network.  The client machine would be
configured with the same network name, it should be able to auto detect
the channel number.

Driver support is very good, there are only a few wireless chipsets,
and I believe that all but the newest 802.11b Plus (22Mbps) and 802.11a
hardware has Linux drivers.

The ADR (Advanced Digital Recording) tape format is an interesting
option, one I hadn't seen much of, before.  Look as if OnStream (spun
off from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly
control the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make
compatible media under licence.

If you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a
rotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn
(and well before they start failing).  That requires at least a couple
of dozen tapes for the first couple of years.  Therefore, cost and
availability of media are (or should be) a major factor.  Also, tape
heads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan
systems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always
ends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy
competition.

The less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is
that, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement
that would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another 
OnStream ADR drive.  In that sense, you're somewhat locked in:  I'm 
not seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed
them).  

If OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into
the system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they 
get people to buy in.   I see the following prices for mail order 
(http://www.finnsoft.com/priclist/verbat.htm) of Verbatim-brand tapes:

42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape
33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape.
44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
47 euros for ADR cleaning tape.

(You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.)

Capacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression
ratio.  The PDF datasheet for Onstream's ""ADR2"" series says this is a
linear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT,
and LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and
8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads).

I'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite
Technology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives.  My recollection
is that BRU will do it.

On balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3
or DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one
oddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the
experience.  But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed,
and might be a good bet after all.  As they say in the gaming industry,
""Ya pays your money, and ya takes your chances.""

[ILUG] PNP collision avoidance question,Ronan Cunniffe <ronan@cunniffe.net>,ilug@linux.ie,"Sat, 17 Aug 2002 21:14:08 +0100","Hi all,
      I have an ISA PNP card that will use io 0x200 if available.  If located at
0x200 the card never works, at 0x210 it always does.  I suspect the problem is
the soundcard (Creative SB PCI-64) gameport controller, which also seems to live
here.  I'm not using the controller, so it doesn't show in /proc/ioports, so
autodetect happily puts my ISA card there.
      I can get the card to work easily enough using isapnptools, banning the
0x200 range in /etc/isapnp.gone, and then using ""insmod radio-cadet io=0x210"",
but I'd like to get the autodetect working, so what I think I'm looking for is
some way of adding ""don't go here, don't bother me"" entries into /proc/ioports.

Anybody?

I didn't think that jot was installed on Linux systems by default,
so from the tone of Padraigs mail that's not what he wanted,
however, if I'm incorrect (don't have a Linux system to hand) the
following is the syntax.

jot -b ""string"" 3

clever. A bit more robust is:
#first param is number of
#times to repeat second param
#
#e.g. quote=`repeat 3 '> '`
repeat() {
     seq -s , $1 | sed ""s¬[0-9]\{1,\}[,]*¬$2¬g""
}

btw loops in bash are shit slow! see:

huh?  i missed all this.  do you want the string all on one line?

the string repeated over and over, but with linebreaks in between,
this works:

    yes ""$STRING"" | head -""$NUMBER""

use sed to remove the newline i guess if you want.  the utilities yes,
head and sed are on pretty much every unix.

Good. I actually looking at `yes` but I was in
slow mode on Friday and didn't consider combining with `head`

To remove newlines then handiest is: tr -d '\n'

[ILUG] Tracking NFS users,Mel <mel@csn.ul.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Mon, 19 Aug 2002 11:04:02 +0100","
Lets say we have an nfs server with nfsd running really high load. nfsstat
will tell you roughly how much traffic is going through with access,
getattr with either client or server but it won't tell you who is doing
it. Is there any way on server side to determine what client is causing
the most usage, and on the client side, is there a way to determine which
process?

I've got a small problem but still annoying. I upgraded from RH 7.1 to

simply doesn't work, it gives the following error from he shell as well 
as from the startup while loading the kernel:  hwclock: ioctl() to

Maybe give us some more information about your hardware.

If you happen to be using an S3 Savage graphics card (as used in
the IBM Thinkpad T20 and probably others) and you get strange display
problems plus the freezing problem then set this environment variable:
  SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50=true
You will need this environment variable set when running soffice,
so you should add an export line to your .bashrc.

Hope this helps,

David

Give yourself credit :-) it's a nice solution,
with just 2 lightweight processes. The same thing
coded in shell loops wouldn't be nearly as elegant
and not as scalable to boot.

hmm... with pthreads there is always one thread which acts as a 
'thread manager'. do the number of processes accumulate? or is it 
just that the # of threads is == # of threads you're expecting + 1? 
if the latter, ttbomk that is normal.

ie, you dont create the thread until the accept() returns. so up 
until then its a normal programme (ie no thread manager). after that 
you will always have +1 processes (for the thread manager).

also, the stack for further threads is allocated from the heap. (see
sigaltstack() ) possibly glibc does not brk() back the space, just
like malloc()/free() does not always release the space to the heap
again (as most programmes will allocate memory / threads again
soonish anyway).

Hi there,

I recently delved into how the linux system clock and the hardware clock
interact with each other when I set up ntp on my system while connected
to the net. However, I didn't realise that Windows altered the hw clock
as there was no mention of it in any of the docs I read. 
I still dual-boot on a regular basis and if Windows is sneakily messing
with the clock, I'd be interested to know in what way it is and how it
couild be stopped from doing so. Everything seems to work fine since I
set the system up but I still don't like to have these gaps in my
knowledge.

Regards,
Anthony Geoghegan

In my experience Windows will change the hardware clock the first time
you boot into it after the clocks have gone forward/back an hour.  This
will only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I
just switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a
reboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?

With ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with
the clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe
this only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows
change only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp
will be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time
precision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).

Hi all,
	I am seriously thinking of getting the ADSL ""solo"" connection
from Eircom. I also have more than one computer therefore I need a router
so that I can connect them together.
The 2 options I am looking at are : 
  the ADSL usb modem connected to my linux machine, with the linux
	machine acting as firewall; and
  a combined router / firewall box which would be connected directly
	to the ADSL modem.

So my questions are : 
	what recommendations would any of you have about the above ?
	do I need to have NAT (I have only a vague idea of what this does )?
	what other options should I be looking at ?

Hi

I have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. I am completely new
to Linux and therefore have run into a few problems.

The graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly
miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes
). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2),
and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.

Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT
Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again
it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.

If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more.
Please keep in mind I am new to it though.

It could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more

Some logs might be of some help.

1) some output of /var/log/maillog with some relevant error message
(that could be /var/log/mail.log or some other log depending on your
configuration)

2) the output from ``postconf -n''

On another note, you did recreate the mailboxes, didn't you?

Mutt interacts with smtpdaemon or something like that doesn't it?

Can mutt interact directly with SMTP server with authentication
capabilities? I don't think it can. 

Surely you can just run a mailserver on your own machine and send
mail using it?

 Hmm. Yeah, mutt sorta calls the sendmail program directly. But I thought
it would be very crap if the auth details (username, password) had to be
hardcoded into the sendmail.cf (and damned if I can work out how to do
that anyway).

well, it changes the time then, and then leaves it alone.

However, Windows expects the time in the RTC to be local time. Linux
can be configured to do either this, or to have the RTC at UTC,
and then use /etc/localtime to figure out the right timezone.

Depending on how you've set it up, this may be a problem (with one
or other of the OS's one hour out). OS-X also does this silliness :(

(RTC should always have UTC, that way different people can set their
own timezone on the machine... though I suppose that only applies
to multi-user machines).

[ILUG] relating data from 2 ascii files ?,Declan Grady <Declan.Grady@nuvotem.com>,Irish Linux Users Group <ilug@linux.ie>,"Wed, 21 Aug 2002 12:26:29 +0100","Hi folks,
Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, but I am trying to do on my linux desktop what I used to do with some other os software.

I'm trying to use a combination of some bash scripts and some perl to generate reports from a couple of ascii files. Eventually these will run on a server and get the files by ftp, analyse them and mail me the results.

As I'm no programmer (by any stretch of the imagination !) I'm getting a bit lost.

I can deal with single files (eventually) using grep, egrep, awk, and a nice perl script called 'total' which i found while googling.

Problem now is that the data I'm trying to report on is split between two isam files.

File 1 contains
Docket Number, Line Number, Item, quantity, price, duedate

File 2 contains
Docket Number, Customer, Shipping date, invoice number.

To make some sense of the data, I need to relate the Docket number between the 2 files, so that I can generate a report by customer.

My first reaction is to look at mysql, and import the ascii data into 2 tables so that I can use sql queries.

Is this the way to go, or should I delve a bit deeper into perl ?

Any advice welcome.

Thanks,
Declan

Another method is to get a small screwdriver that you can consider

[IIU] IE nameserver problems,James Raftery <james-iiu@now.ie>,iiu@taint.org,"Fri, 19 Jul 2002 14:59:18 +0100","Hi,

Four of the IE nameservers are publishing out of date DNS information.
The four listed below are publishing the IE zone from last Friday.
They are six days behind reality.

 192.16.202.11    NS.EU.NET.
 192.93.0.4       NS2.NIC.FR.
 198.133.199.102  GNS1.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.
 198.133.199.103  GNS2.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.

The upshot of this is that correct DNS resolution for IE DNS data that
has been added or updated since last Friday is going to be 
intermittant. If you're lucky your resolver will query one of the five
nameservers that are publishing an up-to-date zone. Unfortunately, five
out of nine aren't good odds.

Don't forget, if you lose the gamble your resolver is going to cache
the bad data for up to two days.

If you're a user of BIND 8 or BIND 9 you could add

	blackhole {
		192.16.202.11;
		192.93.0.4;
		198.133.199.102;
		198.133.199.103;
	};

to your named.conf and restart BIND to avoid query the bad nameservers.
This will prevent _any_ queries to those servers.

Putting

	16.1.0.18
	204.123.2.18
	16.1.0.19
	192.111.39.100
	212.17.32.2
	193.1.142.2

in /service/dnscache/root/servers/ie and restarting dnscache will
have the same result for dnscache users.

James,
Last week, when indexing stuff for WhoisIreland.com, I noticed that
ns0.domainregistry.ie and banba.domainregistry.ie were out of synch by a
few days. The other nameservers seemed to give a current SOA at that
time. However the affected secondaries may have been using
ns0.domainregistry.ie for axfr and propagated the error.

This whole thing does seriously bring into question IEDR's decision to
outsource the technical admininstration of .ie to a company that
apparently does not even admin its own DNS.  It is a nice story though -
almost as good as the time that .ie disappeared for 8 hours in July
1998.

We had a pretty serious crash on the list host over the weekend, and it
destroyed all configuration data.  As a result, I've had to rebuild the

past list traffic.

If you're a list subscriber, you may have received a ""welcome to the list""
mail. All well and good.  However, if you *used* to be subscribed to one 
of the lists at some point in 2002, or never were (I'm hoping that didn't

If you're a list admin on any of the lists at lists.boxhost.net or

I don't know what role ns0 plays in relation to the IE zone. It's
certainly not involved in the regular resolution process. It may
be involved in zone distribution as you suggest. IIRC (and I often
don't) on Friday ns0 had a serial that none of the IE nameservers 
shared. Unfortunately I don't have a record of that.

  your assertion ]

As an aside, shortly after my note on Friday uucp-gw-1.pa.dec.com and
uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com stopped responding to DNS requests. So IE had
two dead nameservers, four stuck a week in the past and three
working correctly. Marvellous.

Yeah but I was right and I was there. The people who were saying that it
did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back
after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at
the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the
.ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the
secondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an
NFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not
there, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.

Confirm that. The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from
what I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the
initial SOA problems. 

I am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for
inclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically
incapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands
the admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS
for its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be
investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the
company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not
actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company
should be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss
of synch should not happen with a national domain. Ireland as E-hub -
more like e-jit central! :)

[IIU] spyware calling home?,Brian O'Brien <obrienbrian@eircom.net>,iiu@taint.org,"Sat, 03 Aug 2002 20:18:48 +0100","Hello all
I'm looking for advice. My pc has developed a disturbing tendency of trying
to access IP 62.17.143.253 without my consent. It has got to the stage where
normal web-browsing is almost impossible.
I have checked IP address on RIPE database and I know precisely who is being
called. I contacted that company on 14 July, when the problem first arose
and asked for a remedy but (surprise) got no reply.
A helpful person on the ie.comp list suggested Adaware spyware removal. I
ran this and haven't had a problem again until today.
The offending program is obviously not in Adaware db. (I run adaware with
current ref files every day now).
Any suggestions, please,  for removing whatever the f*** is causing this
from my pc?

I believe you get more value for money by separating the mobile phone from 
the PDA.

As expressed by power users on Open, a combination like a EUR 160 Nokia 
6310i talking to a EUR 440 Palm m515 will meet your specification. By using 
a EUR 90 Bluetooth SD chip, the Palm and the Nokia 6310i can talk to one 
another even when not in line of sight.

thanks for the good information on the choice of phones, pda choices.

as an aside i also saw that 3com have released a usb blootooth dongle. 
that in a lptp combined with a 6310i with the blootooth (with HSCSD)

I have in my possession the following:

2/3     Apple toner cartridges    M20 45G/A for laser writer 300 / 320 /
and 4/600 PS
1     Apple toner cartridge     M2473G/A  for laser writer 16/600PS /

1     Cannon EP-A cartridge
1     Cannon EP-E cartridge

Does anyone have one of these printers? Does anyone want to give me the 
change in their pockets, or the price of a pint for them?
They would make a great Christmas present!

If so you can call the printer cartridge hotline on the number below.

I had Apache, mod_php and MySQL running on windows 95 once :)

As far as I remember, the only problem was getting the MSI installer installed
on win 95, but that was mentioned in the docs. w2k has that built in, so you
won't have that problem. You should be able to find pre-built binaries for 
win32.

For perl try activestate.com, that's worked for me in the past.

[Webdev] mod_rewrite question,"""John P. Looney"" <valen@tuatha.org>",webdev@linux.ie,"Thu, 15 Aug 2002 17:15:53 +0100"," I'm trying to wrap Zope up behind apache, so I can do VirtualHosts for
Zope.

 I've a site on http://ip:8080/mysite.

 I want that to appear as http://mysite.com/ - so:

<VirtualHost 192.168.2.11>
        ServerName mysite.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/mysite

</VirtualHost>

 Now, what happens is that apache grabs http://localhost:8080/mysite/ and spits
it out to the browser. Lovely. all works.

 Except for framed pages (like Zope's management interface). It ends up
looking like:

    <frameset rows=""34, *"">
    <frame src=""http://localhost:8080/reenactors/manage_top_frame""

It sounds more like you're looking for a commercial service, in which

er, i understood you until you reached the above. Maybe its my lack of PHP

With most languages you parse the submitted form data and should come out 
with either variables or an array / hash, which you then work with and name 
whatever you like.

IIRC, if the query string contains

varname=FIRST&varname=SECOND

then PHP will create a variable called ""varname"" with result SECOND. 
However, if the query string contains

varname[]=FIRST&varname[]=SECOND

then PHP will create an array with varname[1]==FIRST and varname[2]==SECOND

There are other ways to get the data from the HTTP request, and I guess 
I'll do that if it turns out to simplify the script that creates the 
form; but as i understand it that's the ""official"" way to get data from 
a SELECT MULTIPLE using PHP.

By far the coolest solution to this would be to ""fix"" php :)
Take a look at main/php_variables.c in the php source distribution.
You could mess around with the variable is_array in
php_register_variable_ex() and see if you can force all variables to be
arrays :) As far as I can tell the reason they do this is to save
time by not having to work out which variables have multiple values.

[Webdev] PHP/MySQL Virtual Hosting Recommendations?,elvin@eircom.net,webdev@linux.ie,"Wed, 21 Aug 2002 19:44:28 +0100","Hi,

I am looking at the options for a UNIX/Linux Virtual Server capable of holding multiple domains - preferably not tooo expensive as I am not a business. I wish to build a few PHP/MySQL sites and host them...

A rough list of features I am after are

Circa 50MB-100MB web space for now
POP email accounts 
Account Control Panel 
Perl 
PHP 
MySQL 
FTP and Telnet Access 24/7
Own CGI-BIN
Webalizer Graphical Stats 
Server Side Includes 
Good Reachable Technical Support

I have seen a great looking 300MB solution in the region of 600Euro p.a. which at the moment is a bit over my financial head in one payment - I haven't completed any sites yet, but have a few potential jobs coming up.

Any tips/pointers much appreciated!

1. Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Historically, families have usually had more children than parents,
resulting in family trees that looked like pyramids. However, in
recent years, especially in countries like Britain and the US, the
number of children per generation has steadily gone down, while
life span has increased. This has led to a shape of family tree
that some researchers have likened to a beanpole - tall and thin,
with few people in each generation. The term ""beanpole family"" has
been around in the academic literature at least since 1987, but it
rarely appears elsewhere. A recent British report has brought it to
wider public notice, at least in the UK. Some researchers find it
too slangy and prefer the jargon term ""verticalised"" to describe
such families. Whatever term you prefer, specialists are sure that
the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal
relationships within the family and (for example) the role of
grandparents.

The rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the
'beanpole' family. With almost one in two marriages ending in
divorce, many adults have at least two families, each with a single
child.
                                             [""Observer"", May 2002]

Noting the rising number of so-called 'beanpole' families in
Britain (families with only one child), the report warns that a
child without siblings 'is starved of the companionship of family
members of their own age ... [leading to] greater social isolation,
with teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life'.
                                            [""Guardian"", June 2002]


2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A stupid person, a blockhead.

Unfortunately, this useful and effective insult has rather dropped
out of use in these mealy-mouthed times. The last excursion for it
that I can find is in the classic W C Fields film ""The Bank Dick""
of 1940, in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line:
""Surely, don't be a luddie-duddie, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a
jabbernow, you're not those, are you?"". Before that, it turns up in
one of the novels of Hall Caine in 1890, but even by then it seems
to have been rather rare.

It's from the old French ""jobard"", from ""jobe"", silly. That word
was then added to ""noll"", the top or crown of the head, the noddle.
The first sense was of a block-like or stupid-looking head, but was
soon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within.
""Jobbernowlism"" is the condition or state of being a ""jobbernowl"",
or an act or remark that is especially stupid.

Careful how you use it: the recipient might be a subscriber!


3. Beyond Words
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been away at a heritage conference in Colchester these past
few days. On my way back, my eye was caught by this warning sign
posted above some steps at the local railway station:

   Caution
   Do not run on the stairs
   Use the hand rail


4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer
electronics, home systems, burglar alarms, etc. I very often come
across the expression ""bells and whistles"", which seem to relate to
equipment, accessories or features that are offered to the customer
as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work.
Is that right? And where does that funny phrase come from? [Herve
Castelain, France]

Q. You're right about the meaning of this phrase, which refers to
gimmicks - non-essential but often engaging features added to a
piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem
more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function.

The phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the
American military. At least, one of its earliest appearances was in
an article in ""Atlantic"" in October 1982, which said it was
""Pentagon slang for extravagant frills"". There's some evidence that
the term has actually been around since the 1960s, but the early
evidence is sparse.

Where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate. A literal
sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth
century, referring to streetcars, railways and steamships. Before
modern electronics, there were really only two ways to make a loud
warning noise - you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle. Steam
made the latter a real power in the land (anybody who has heard the
noisy out-of-tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans
will agree about its power, though less so about its glory). And at
one time ""clang, clang, clang went the trolley"" in large numbers of
American cities.

At least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and
whistles, as this extract from an article in ""Appleton's Journal""
of 1876 shows:

  You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping
  along the edge of a precipice, two-thirds up the rocky
  height, a train of red-and-yellow railway-cars, drawn by
  two wood-burning engines, the sound of whose bells and
  whistles seems like the small diversions of very little
  children, so diminished are they by the distance.

Could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought
excessive, a case of belt and braces, an unnecessary feature, a
frill?

Possibly. But it's more probable the slang sense of the term comes
from that close musical relative of the calliope, the theatre
organ. Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer
augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to
help the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns,
sirens, and bird whistles. These effects were called toys, and
organs often had ""toy counters"" with 20 or more noisemakers on
them, including various bells and whistles. In the 1950s, decades
after the talkies came in, but while theatre organs were still
common in big movie houses, these fun features must have been
considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but
mere fripperies, inessential add-ons.

It's possible the slang sense grew out of that. It got taken up
especially by the computing industry, perhaps because opportunities
to add them are so great.

                        -----------

Q. The designation of ""robes"" for academic dress clearly comes from
its origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages. But what about
""mortarboards""? The best I could find was its origin in the 12th or
13th century clergy cap, but that was not square-shaped. Does
""mortarboard"" refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient?

A. The academic cap often called a ""mortarboard"" is quite ancient,
but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth
century (a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a
""square""). The literal mortar board is the wooden plate, usually
with a handle underneath, on which bricklayers carry small amounts
of mortar. A similar tool is used by plasterers, but they usually
call it a hawk.

What seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between
the brickie's board and the academic cap led some wag, probably at
Oxford University, to apply the name of the one to the other. Our
first recorded use is in a book of 1853-6, ""The Adventures of Mr.
Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman"" by a clergyman named Edward
Bradley, who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede (the names
of the two patron saints of Durham, where he went to school).
Verdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book
recounts his adventures. This magisterial reprimand by a don
appears after one such escapade: ""I will overlook your offence in
assuming that portion of the academical attire, to which you gave
the offensive epithet of 'mortar-board'; more especially, as you
acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have
known better"".

After a slow start, the book became a huge success, selling more
than 200,000 copies in the next 20 years. Whether Mr Bradley
invented the slang term we may never know, but his book certainly
popularised it.

                        -----------

Q. I got into a discussion about ""chip off the old block"" with
friends, and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting,
jewelry making, woodworking, or none of the above. What does this
term mean, and where did it come from? [Vijay Renganathan]

A. The associations are with carpentry, and the block is definitely
made of wood.

The first form of the expression was ""chip of the same block"",
meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as
somebody or something else, so from the same source or parentage.
An early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson (at one time
Bishop of Lincoln), dated 1637: ""Am not I a child of the same Adam
... a chip of the same block, with him?"".

Later that century, another form is recorded ""a chip of the old
block"", which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his
father, or continued some family characteristic. At some point,
probably late in the nineteenth century, this was modified to ""a
chip off the old block"", which does nothing to change the sense,
but is the way it's now usually written or said.

Razor/Client.pm is part of Razor v1. You've installed Razor v2.
Spamassassin's current release only works with v1. Although IIRC
the current CVS code works with v2.

Thanks, Tabor.  How do I install v1 over v2, and where does one
get it?  (I don't see it at razor.sourceforge.net)

It's there. Scroll down on the downloads page. However you might
consider going the other way and installing SpamAssassin's 2.40
bleeding-edge code as Razor v2 has a lot of nice features over v1.

To paraphrase something I heard once:
Unless you like looking for a new job, never install a non-released or
development-only version of software anywhere where the results of such
code are important.

ie: Don't run development code on a production machine. :)


The problem isn't SA anyway, it looks for Razor1 and just keeps on
going if it can't find it.  Something came up about amavis on the SA
list where it looks for Razor itself...

Hmmm... installed SA 2.40, but I get the same error when trying
to launch amavisd-new (can't find Razor/Client.pm).  Seems like
the amavis code is calling for this.  I'll hit up the
amavis-users list.  (Feel free to fire off the answer if you
have it, though!   :)

I believe this is fixed (or at least there's a workaround in place to try

And where does it say production-ready? http://razor.sourceforge.net says at
the top of the page:

June 13, 2002 - Vipul's Razor v2 released! The first beta of Vipul's Razor
v2 is now available for public download.

Likewise Vipul's announcement post about v2 to this list states that it is 
beta in the first sentence.

I sit corrected. I guess we could argue if it's even beta quality(I'd say
I have about a 50/50 chance of reports being submitted), but I
don't think that would be productive. :-)

1)  I think the code is still very much pre-beta.

2)  When you go to the ""Download"" page, it tells you ""Fetch the latest
versions of razor-agents and razor-agents-sdk packages""  It is not at all
clear that these are development packages.

The site is badly designed, and very misleading.  IMO.  The fact that the
word ""beta"" appears in the middle of some introductory text on the front
page is hardly a valid argument.  (Well accepted software design ""fact"":
USERS DON'T READ *ANYTHING*)

I get the impression that Vipul & co are deliberately trying to mislead
users into downloading the dev code in order to get more unwitting test
sites.

But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

Apologies to all.  In re-reading, that sentence sounds a lot harsher than I
intended.

As the old maxim goes, ""Never ascribe to malice that which can be equally
explained by incompetence"".

I'll shut up now.

The question I have is: what needs to be done/help needs to be provided to
make the system suck less? It's obviously a great idea, it just needs some
work...

That's simple.  The same thing that any beta project needs to improve.
Continuous
End-User testing, constructive feedback, and suggestions on how to improve
the
system.  Upgrade each time a new beta version comes out, so everyone is
testing
on the same version of the code, and old bugs don't get reported as being in
the
new version, thus slowing down the debugging process.

Report any installation issues, bugs, errors, etc., to the V2 beta list
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-testers) so that they can
be quickly
looked at, etc.  Provide detailed description of issues, include logs if
possible,
as well as any ""captured"" spam that generated the error(s).


Thank you, please drive through,
- AA -

   ·   Improved logic for detecting spam, now we only look at
       visible and/or significant mime parts.  [chad, vipul]

   ·   Mime parts cleaned to only whitespace are now ignored
       on the client side, that is, they are not checked
       against server [chad]

       [chad]

   ·   Backup any existing identity files before writing over

   ·   Fixed a bug when we rediscover, we save info to list
       correctly but when using it we skip the first server

       .*xx' not 'From .*xx' (Note the ':') [chad]

   ·   Made exit codes cleaner [chad]
        0 or 1       => no error

  Content-Type: message/rfc822 mails are handled like attachments
  and are not broken down further into mime parts.  That is, the attachment
  is treated as one part.  The headers and body of the message/rfc822 are
  sent to the server without parsing.  The other way to handle it is to treat it like
  a regular mail, and break it down into parts.
  
  There are reasons to break it down and not to break it down, and right 
  now we chose not to break it down.  This might change in the future.

I just want to be sure, that forwarding an email to my own spamtrap address
which performs a razor-report on the entire received email is not waste of
time, because the contents of the forwarded email is not recognized as equal
to the email originally received. The forwarded email has a new set of
headerlines, which should be discarded and instead the headerlines of the
original message are in the body of this new message and should be recognized
as such and treated properly.

An ordinary Forward Unquoted in Agent is subject to character set conversions
and does not depict the received spam in its original form.

I hope this clarifies my concerns.

[Razor-users] Routine problem; this time it's mine.,Brian Fahrlander <kilroy@kamakiriad.com>,razor-users@example.sourceforge.net,"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 12:07:18 -0500","
    I hate to ask...I've heard it mentioned several times here, but I couldn't find a digest, and the hits I found on Google turned up missing pages.  :(

    I thought I was reporting spams all this time...the last month or so...but I wasn't.  I had a pathing problem going on, and a log-pathing problem, too, but hadn't noticed it yet.  Now, the system seems to be working, other than this message in the logs:

    nextserver: Could not get valid info from Discovery Servers

    What's the fix for this again?  Is it a server outtage, or something else?

    I'm using the 2.03 sdk, and the new 2.14 agent...

"[Razor-users] can't call method ""log"" issue - solution",Steven Champeon <schampeo@hesketh.com>,razor-users@example.sourceforge.net,"Wed, 31 Jul 2002 17:31:05 -0400","
I see that Robert S. Wojciechowski Jr. posted about this issue on 7/26,
but I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report
from a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user.
The way I solved it was to run 

razor-admin -create

and

razor-admin -discover

with a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is
explicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe.

The manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be
loaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a
.razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist
(although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may
lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery
and other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The
workaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to
razorhome on the command line, e.g.

razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create
razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discover

15 seconds is more than enough timeout... There's no request/minute limit,
and we are not close to hardware limits on any of the servers.

Could you send me relevant sections from the log file as well as
your config?

It would appear that even though there is a specified home directory,
razor-check cannot read the .lst files and must apparently run discovery at
each lookup?????

This, btw, is occuring on two separate servers ...

	http://www.stearns.org/razor-caching-proxy/ is what you're looking

There have been several changes in the trust system recently. We'll start

[Razor-users] False Positives on EFF Messages,Marc Perkel <marc@perkel.com>,razor-users@example.sourceforge.net,"Fri, 02 Aug 2002 15:01:42 -0700","Hi everyone,

I'm the systems admin for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and I'm using razor 
running under spam assassin there and one my own personal server. Generally it 
works fine with near 0 false positives - except - that almost all the false 
positives I've seen are on messages that originated at EFF.

So - I am wondering why RAZOR is catching EFF email and how is this happening. 
Below is an example of what I'm talking about.

Document: HP backs off DMCA threat

By CNET News.com Staff
August 1, 2002, 6:10 PM PT

Hewlett-Packard Thursday abandoned legal threats it made against security 
analysts who publicized flaws in the company's software.

In a statement released late Thursday, HP said it would not use the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a controversial copyright law, to pursue a 
loosely-organized team of researchers who demonstrated a bug in the company's 
Tru64 Unix operating system.

The following is the company's statement:

1) HP is committed to protecting our customer's security environments.

2) We have verified that there is a security vulnerability with Tru64 UNIX, the 
details of which were brought to our attention July 18. The problem has now been 
isolated and HP has been preparing a fix, which will be available within the 
next 48 hours.

3) We won't comment on the specifics of our discussions with SnoSoft. However, 
we take our customers' security requirements very seriously and have a strong 
track record following industry-standard security practices.

4) Where and how the DMCA should be applied is a matter of great controversy. 
The reported letter to SnoSoft was not consistent or indicative of HP's policy. 
We can say emphatically that HP will not use the DMCA to stifle research or 
impede the flow of information that would benefit our customers and improve 
their system security.

I added code to my procmailrc (on the other account) so that anything that 
comes on Bugtraq and is in Razor is revoked. Bugtraq is moderated, so spam 
doesn't get through it. The recipe revoked a message about an hour after I 
added it.

The problem with automatic revoke is the same as with automatic
report.  If spammers spoof a From: Bugtraq address then their spam is
automatically revoked by you.

Good point, but notice that cmeclax said in his example procmail recipe:

   :0
   * !^(some Bugtraq-specific header)

It should be possible to pick a header that a spammer is not likely forge. He was
even careful not to reveal in public just what header(s) he is checking.

setup the config of pine to

[Razor-users] Change timeout setting???,Sven <sven@dmv.com>,razor-users@example.sourceforge.net,"Mon, 05 Aug 2002 10:32:40 -0400","This is a semi-followup on my previous question. I am running razor-check
through a sendmail milter (smrazor http://www.sapros.com/smrazor/ ) and have
set up my milter timeouts to 20sec connect and 30 sec response. The problem
is that there is another timeout setting for razor-check that I am unable to
locate. My razor-agent.log is now getting filled with :

check[6149]: [ 3] Timed out (15 sec) while reading from honor.cloudmark.com.

So the question is, is there a razor-agent.conf file setting to increase
this timeout value? I have this problem on 2 different servers now (as
apparently ubik.cloudmark and apt.cloudmark are refusing connections) ......

It seems that an email consisting of a single line containg a
control-M is detected as spam. 

It also seems that an email consisting of 5 blank lines is also
treated as spam:

efes:~% rm -f qq
efes:~% perl -e 'for($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) { print ""\n""; }' >> qq
efes:~% razor-check -d qq > /tmp/bar
efes:~% grep 'known spam' /tmp/bar
Aug 05 16:07:20.141526 check[31105]: [ 3] mail 1 is known spam.

I'm running Razor-agents 2.14.

These examples are based on real-life false-positives found by my
users. One of the reals emails was sent by a user which wrote the 
real contents of the email in the Subject field.

I thought the newer Razor-releases avoided these problems.

You should also enable raw mode (ctrl-w) and delimiters (ctrl-r) before 
directing messages to the pipe. Raw mode includes the headers and 
delimiters allow several messages to be submitted.

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last two

upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to normal.
Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy, specially with

The likelyhood of EFF or other mailing lists getting filtered will
decrease over time as these mails are revoked whenever they get filtered
out. Revocations help the system to punish reporters who report legit bulk
mail such that their future reports are automatically considered suspect.
As such, with all the new changes to TeS, the likelyhood of filtering
mailing list posts has decreased dramatically. Please keep me posted if
you see false positives on the EFF newsletter again.

Hi,

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last
two days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to
the upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to
normal. Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy,
specially with regards to false-positives.

Thanks that helps.  There's still so little info on TES and those of us
here since RazorV1 know how it works.  I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100""
which I thought would be zero.  

So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a
trust level of 1 and have to work their way up.  Your trust level
increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must
have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the
changes dumped everyone's trust level.  Now here come the questions...

What engine signature does TES look at?  Does it have to be the same e1
signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures.  How many people have
to nominate the message before everyones rating increases?  How many
revokes decreases someones rating?  Does a single revoke decrease the
rating of everyone that nominated the message?  If a newby reports a
message that has already been reported does their trust level
immediately go up?  In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust
level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple
people with higher trust levels?

Bobby, 

Couple of things: 

If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an
immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the
confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam.
This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users
grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become
shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their
legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.

Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in
razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended
average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should
return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a
trusted user).

apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a
_maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.

cheers,
vipul.

My question for the trust system is this. I signed up for a free account

on some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of
data, 
and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The
mailing 
includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few 
links to their book store.

This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, 
and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them

be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even

Who is losing a trust rating here? If it is not unsolicited commercial

Wow. I think a majority of the anti-spam community out there would disagree
with you. It makes no difference what the list is, whether it's run by ZDNet
or Empire Towers, whether it uses open proxies and relays or a MLM like
mailman or Lyris. In either case I was added to a list against my will to 
receive unsolicited bulk email. I shouldn't have to 'just unsubscribe from
the list' any more than I should have to send email with the subject REMOVE
to removemeblahblah1234@yahoo.com or go to http://www.centralremovelist.com/
to 'unsubscribe' from some viagra spam. Or are you advocating that as well?

That's fine. But my point is that neither person in my example was
committing an inherently untrustworthy act. Yet someone's TES would likely
fall because of it.

Hmm. Good point about razor-whitelist. I'd forgotten about that.

[Razor-users] use of exit in razor modules,Thomas Pfau <pfau@nbpfaus.net>,razor-users@example.sourceforge.net,"Fri, 09 Aug 2002 09:20:35 -0400","Every once in a while, I get notifications in my root mailbox that my
personal mail is being rejected.  The message is 'No Catalogue Servers
available at this time.'  Since I use razor V1 through Mail::Audit
(using is_spam), I tried several ways to try to trap this error and
allow my mail to be delivered on these occassions but nothing seemed
to work.

I started digging through the code and found several uses of exit
inside the razor code.  This is a very anti-social thing for a module
to do.  It takes away my option to bypass the spam check and deliver
the mail anyway.  The razor modules should signal errors through die
or warn.  razor-check could catch these and, knowing it's being called
during mail delivery, issue an appropriate message and exit status for
the MTA.  The razor modules don't know who's calling them and
shouldn't make this decision.  I'm wondering how much legitimate mail
I'm missing because of this.

I certainly hope this is being addressed in the new version.

No, I have another account that sends anything that's already in Razor to the 
spamtrap, unless it's a Bugtraq message, in which case I revoke it as that 
account (not as the spamtrap). I'm talking about the situation before I 
checked for Bugtraq in the procmailrc. The message was sent to the spamtrap 
because it was in Razor, then I manually revoked it as the spamtrap because 
it was erroneously reported. The spamtrap is not, and never was, subscribed 
to Bugtraq.

To be more precise, automatic reporting is a Good Thing only if there's
/zero/ possibility of reporting positives falsely (or as close to zero
as makes no difference in the end).

cmeclax's example (which incidentally points out a major vulnerability
of auto-reporting trollboxes) basically says ""I'll blindly report as
spam whatever some other user(s) have reported as spam"".  That ""blindly""
part undermines the very purpose of Razor, so I too hope that:

Maybe I'm the only one confused but what you are saying is that you
have a spamtrap that receives Bugtraq messages and you are auto-
matically reporting them as SPAM only to revoke them shortly there-
after???  Either way automatic reporting is a Bad Thing (tm) IMHO.
You should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise.  I'm not
sure how this would affect your rating because I don't have any docs
nor code to look at but I sincerely hope that if that's what you
are doing that it negatively impacts your rating at a near exponential

My question for the trust system is this. I signed up for a free account 
on some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of data, 
and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The mailing 
includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few 
links to their book store.

This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, 
and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them might 
be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even 
includes a link to terminate your account), I revoke it. Even so, the 
next mail is still flagged as spam.

Who is losing a trust rating here? If it is not unsolicited commercial e-
mail, it should not be reported by Razor as spam -- correct?

Actually you would be inaccurate in your action in a way. The correct 
behavior would be to unsubscribe razor-users@fsckit.net from the mailing 
list.

But in any case, you have to understand that you and him would not be 
the only one involved. As I said in a another thread, you probably get 
hurt only if you are against the majority of people (which makes sense). 
If you are with the majority, you get a bonus (which also makes sense). 
If there is no majority, nobody wins or lose.
Razor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority, 
not for the individual. If one doesn't agree with the majority, he 
should use the razor-whitelist or create a blacklist (BTW, why doesn't 
razor provide a razor-blacklist too?)

Let's take a look at an example here. Someone on this list signed
razor-users@fsckit.net up to a ZDNet mailing list that doesn't confirm
subscriptions in a piss-poor attempt to mailbomb me. I report all of these
mailings to Razor because, guess what, for me this is spam. This and a
hundred more traditional spam emails to automated spamtrap addresses get 
reported by me daily. I probably have a decent TES value because of all of
this.

Now lets say someone else who is also reporting a fair amount of your
typical proxy/relayed spam has been reporting these and has built up a
decent TES rating because of it. However they subscribed to that same ZDNet
list and enjoy getting the mail from it except that they don't like seeing 
it tagged as spam by Razor. So they razor-revoke it. 

Who loses in this case? Why? Neither party is inaccurate in their actions
IMO. But someone's standing is going to get hurt because of it.

Ok, time for me to pipe in.  :)

Honestly, I find it odd that the spam fighting groups aren't working
and playing well, when the common enemy is the spammers, not each
other.  MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to
have issues with Razor.  Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's
fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers.

In a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives
than false negatives.  Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I
use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it.  I
tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like
this exists, yet):

        red     is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from
                several sources, and noone says ""I know this is NOT
                spam.""  I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or
                archive it for humor value.  I expect no
                false-positives to be here.

        yellow  This may be spam.  A human should decide (and report).

        green   This is probably not spam.

spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't
switch, not is/maybe/isn't.  That said, razor is but one check in my
spam fighting arsenal, so if it reports ""doesn't match known spam""
once in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get
it.

I assume that how much the trust goes down depends of the proportion of 
report vs revoke. If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the 
one guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the 
majority, your trust goes up. If you are against the majority, your 
trust goes down. If people 50-50, whatever you vote, your neither 
against the majority nor with it, so your trust won't change. So your
""gray"" mail won't have much influence on your trust (neither good nor

I hope so, here goes.. simple question.  How do you define

I'm assuming when someone connects with SpamNet for the first time, they're
given a unique ID that they keep until they change to a new Outlook client?

It would be nice if you could specify which username/password to use.  I'd

Good! Your opinion of what is spam is unreliable, and therefore, I don't
*want* to trust you. IMHO, that is exactly the case that the trust system is
supposed to sort out. People who incorrectly submit non-spam bulk mail to
razor.

Then those lots of people are unreliable, and therefore will all have

IMHO, due to the number of messages you are sending, and the way you are
discussing TeS, (considering that you know *nothing* about it), certainly
looks like you are simply trying to throw doubt/negativity onto razor.

Personally, I haven't used razor for a few months now because I want to
integrate it into qmail-scanner *without* spam assassin, but haven't had the
time to do that, so even I can't comment on Razor at all.....

Vipul & co, I think it would be great if there was more transparency in the
whole server process, ie, if you know there is a problem, then tell all of
us, this will avoid all the stupid ""Oh, it isn't working again, and it took
me 324 days to work it out"" etc...

Just my $1 worth...

Adam

Perhaps a feature can be added to razor-report, so that it checks whether a
message is spam before it submits it.  If it is spam, then don't send the
body, 4 signatures, etc, just up the ""rating"" for that individual spam.

For the most part, 99% times 99% users agree on what is spam. This is the
nature of the spam problem. Now if you were to use a ""personal trust""
system, you'd have a huge personal trust group that would include 99% of
the userbase. This means 99% times you'd be coming to the same conclusion,
only after burning several orders of magnitude more CPU cycles. That would
be stupid. Also, it would take several orders of magnitude longer to
bootstrap and reach effectiveness. Sub-optimal in the extreme.

As regards to the problems with the ""gray"" areas you mentioned, servers
recognize such content, and razor-agents can use this information to make
individual determination. Not to mention, users can set a local confidence
level they are confortable with.

Yes, it's definitely extra work.  The question is how much extra 
work, both up front, and then on an ongoing basis.  I know 
nothing about how the trust system is working (still waiting for 
that long-promised server code to be published), but now that 
it's been turned on, and the more info that's coming out about 
it, the more concerned I'm becoming that it's extremely easy to 
game; that the initial amount of work to set up a gaming agent 
is low, and that once it's set up, it can be ""fire and forget"" 
in terms of continuing to operate in a way that's not easy to 
distinguish from real user behavior.

Another concern I have with the way the system might be working 
is that it might not actually require very many gamers at all to 
utterly undermine the whole system.  There are a certain number 
of possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive 
to liars, or misclassifiers of ""gray"" mail, or both.  It's not 
clear yet whether this universe is one of those or not.

You do need a certain level of accuracy though, or the filter is 
not economically worthwhile.  If you only filter 75% of spam, 
you're wasting your time.  Some people receive on the order of a 
10:1 ratio of spam:real mail -- 75% means the ratio adjusts to 
5:2 which is still shitty.  95% makes it 1:2, which is better.  
99% makes it 1:10 which is quite nice.  As the global ratio of 
spam:mail rises, this problem gets somewhat more important.  
With an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming spam:real 
ratio, 100:1, 99% effective still works OK.  75% effective is 
now really, really shitty.

Time will tell.  Time will also tell how good the system is at 
adjusting over time to gaming strategies.

SA definitely has a non-zero FP rate, and always will have.  I 
would argue that any system will have a non-zero FP rate, 
including the ""no filter"" filter -- humans make mistakes too 
sometimes!  As spammer strategies evolve over time though, I'm 
fairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate.  If 
spammers figure out how to easily pollute the SpamNet trust 
system, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to replace the trust 
system with something else.

Lots of theorizing, most of it based on little data.  The key 
premises I'm worrying about though are:

1. Trust system is easy to pollute
2. Trust system is not personal, which makes the assumption that 
all honest voters agree on what constitutes spam

Razor2 seems to have been a long time in coming, apparently is 
quite resource intensive (judging by Cloudmark's fundraising 
efforts), and doesn't currently work.  It has great promise, and 
I'm hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through, it'll add 
another powerful tool in the war on spam -- I'm just concerned 
that it's getting off on the wrong foot and might not be able to 
recover.

I was thinking you could easily create a spamtrap which you 
subscribe to lots of legitimate nonspam mailing lists, plus you 
also spread the email address around and get it in the hands of 
lots of spammers so it ends up receiving large quantities of 
both spam and nonspam, then you have it apply the algorithm 
above to the incoming mail stream.  So it could be thousands of 
actual real, different, emails per day.  The ""very high rate 
triggers alarms"" thing is certainly something which would be 
possible to check for, but there may be legitimate ways to 
exhibit this behavior -- can't think of one right now but ""AOL 
proxy server"" springs to mind as an example from another domain.

If there is a maximum trust value (if trust is some sort of percentage
for instance), and if it isn't impossible to reach it, that would 
prevent too few people to get too much of an avantage. My guess is if 1% 
of razor users can reach this limit (or be near enough), spammers won't 
be able to cheat just by building up their trust, they would need a fair 
amount of fake users too.

Now, for the ""fair amount of fake users"", spammers don't have access to 
many set of network classes. So they would need a bunch of users coming 
from the same set of ips. If the razor servers see 100 people on a class 
C network (253 ips) reporting 10000 emails a day, something wrong is 
going on. This could also trigger alarms.

As for legitimate proxies and the like, 1) a proxy should not report any
thing (spam should be reported by hand, not automatically), 2) there may 
be a way to have exception (IBM networks would have lots of users from 
the same set of ips but no likely spammers, so no alarm would trigger 
for their network, or better the alarm would be less sensitive). AOL 
could still give trouble though but even then, for one particular phone 
line/cable, the set of ip is probably quite small even less than a class 
C (using network subclassing). The spammers could still try to have 
several connections at different locations, but that increases their 
cost and so is not so much interesting.

  razor-report only sends the body if the server does not have

  thinks that mail is spam, and uses that info in TeS.

Today was not as bad ... apt.cloudmark was the server du jour and
experienced about 800 ""Unable to connect .... Reason: Operation now in
progress"" out of some 189,000 ""bootup[1]""  or roughly 0.5% -- better than
the 1% before but still a bit higher than I would like. I suspect it is
because a previous timeout from razor-agents has a process id that is being
held by an open milter socket. The process id's cycle, the number comes up
again and the error occurs as a duplicate pid occurs. I will tweak my milter
settings to shorten the total time to allow the socket to live per connect.

In looking at Core.pm I find a couple possible places where that code might
be. Is it:
    my $select = new IO::Select ($sock);
    my @handles = $select->can_read (15);
    if ($handles[0]) {
        $self->log (8,""Connection established"");
        my $greeting = <$sock>;
        # $sock->autoflush; # this is on by default as of IO::Socket 1.18
        $self->{sock} = $sock;
        $self->{connected_to} = $server;
        $self->{select} = $select;
        $self->log(4,""$server >> "". length($greeting) ."" server greeting:
$greeting"");

        return 1 if $params{discovery_server};
        unless ($self->parse_greeting($greeting) ) {
            $self->nextserver or return $self->errprefix(""connect2"");
            return $self->connect;
        }
        return 1;
    } else {
        $self->log (3, ""Timed out (15 sec) while reading from
$self->{s}->{ip}."");
??????
or
    unless ($sock) {
        $sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(
                            PeerAddr => $server,
                            PeerPort => $port,
                            Proto    => 'tcp',
                            Timeout  => 20,
                     );
        unless ( $sock ) {
            $self->log (3,""Unable to connect to $server:$port; Reason:

            return if $params{discovery_server};

[of course the latter reflects a differenct timeout setting altogether - one

It seems that we have all these catalogue servers yet a good portion of the
time, only one is available or the last discovery ends up only listing one
(currently honor.cloudmark) in the cataloge.lst file.

I changed the default discovery period to every 12 hours in order to
compensate for the recent sporadic nature of the servers' availability (I
realize that the issue was related to syncing and server upgrades .... but I
might as well play it safe for a while).

Again, this is not true. Only certain events (reports/revokes) for a spam
are rewarded and the algorithm for picking these up is based on many
different factors.

A lot of the questions/concerns brought up on this list wrt
TeS will be lessened when the source for it is released.  Any
guestimate on when that might happen?

i don't think you get exactly what razor does. razor is used to stop
spam
from entering a mail box, not to leave a mail server. altough you could
probably use it that way i doubt it would do much good (if the mail is
leaving the server, it most likely is a new spam and wouldn`t get caught
by
razor)

you might want to look into dealing with those troublesome users
directly.
and (as you`ve probably been screamed at a lot of times) close your open

Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem.  If untrusted strangers
are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that
you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create
an rcpthosts file or something).

Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I
would suggest tossing qmail-scanner <http://qmail-scanner.sf.net/>
and SpamAssassin <http://www.spamassassin.org/> into the mix as well.
The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter
does its work (including razor-check invocations).

Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying
relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find
out how to do that, go to <http://www.qmail.org/> (which, incidentally,
should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for ""qmail
newbie's guide to relaying"".

Ah...  You learn something new every day!  This would make things 
quite a bit easier.  I assume it can handle a mailbox full of mail to 
report rather than a single piece of spam from STDIN.  I'll check the 
docs on that though.

Thanks!

Why not just use spamassassin -r?


       -r, --report
           Report this message as verified spam.  This will sub-
           mit the mail message read from STDIN to various spam-
           blocker databases, such as Vipul's Razor (
           http://razor.sourceforge.net/ ) and the Distributed
           Checksum Clearinghouse ( http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-
           spam/dcc/ ).

           If the message contains SpamAssassin markup, this will
           be stripped out automatically before submission.

Yeah, I disabled the subject rewrite.  I also lowered required_hits 
to 1 (wonder if I can do zero) so that almost all mail is scored--I'm 
testing it right now.  auto_report_threshold was raised to 100 to 
make sure that all mail gets through to me for now.

Ah, now I didn't notice this.  I rather like this option.  I may set

This makes sense.  I may do that for just this reason.  Thanks!

Unfortunately not, it's a one at a time thing.  If it would help
you, I have a script that I use which handles a mbox file at a time,
strips the SA stuff, reports to razor, and can then do things like
open relay checks, reports to spamcop, etc.  It's available via:

I'll give that a looksie.  I've been running a week's worth of 
maillog relay= IPs through rbcheck every Sunday.  Found quite a few. 
I should break up the list and run multiple rbcheck instances.  Just 
haven't gotten there yet though.  I think I'll have either MIMEDefang 
or Procmail keep a copy of messages over a certain score for daily 
razor-reporting.  I could just let SA do it too I suppose.

Say, maybe you can tell me what I'm doing wrong in SA.  I added 
report_header 1 to my 
/etc/mail/mimedefang/spamassassin/sa-mimedefang.cf but it didn't 
appear to change anything.  I bounced over another copy of spam to my 
spamtrap and it still created the SPAM: attachment.  sa-mimedefang.cf 
has this in it now:

required_hits           1
auto_report_threshold   100
ok_locales              en
rewrite_subject 0
report_header 1
use_terse_report 1
defang_mime 0
skip_rbl_checks 1

I can't figure out if that was the write cf to modify or not.  I also 
have a /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf but it's empty.  I think I 
might be taking too many bites out of too many pies at once. :-)  The 
required_hits changes I made to sa-mimedefang.cf seem to have worked. 
I don't know why the report_header change didn't though.  Any ideas?

As long as you're not using razor2, that is, right?

I wouldn't make that assumption.  I'd assume that rewrite_subject was on, 
and report_header was off, because that's the default configuration, and 
not everyone knows to go look in the user_prefs file to make those 
changes.

Erps.  I did misword that.  The message (and assumption) was oriented
toward a message that has rewrite_subject on and report_header off...the
default configuration.  For the header removals it contained enough to
also take care of dcc_add_header 1, but not report_header 1.

thanks.

IMO 2 separate rules is a good idea anyway, razor2 has totally different

Because you then have a system that is ineffective to a varying degree. A
simplistic view would be that 999 subscribers received a piece of spam
that could have otherwise been avoided. But the reality is likely that
many, many more individuals would have received the piece of spam when you
factor in report times.

Wrong. razor-check will tell you if a specific piece of mail matches
something already in the database. If you have the system pretend to have
never seen a piece of mail, how do you propose people use the system for
filtering?

No, it means that the people doing the revoking have a different opinion
than the 1000 people who have submitted it as spam. Rather the 1000 people
who have reported the message as spam constitute a majority or not is
something that would have to be determined in the context of the
individual message.

It's my opinion that it's not my job to unsubscribe to any list that I
haven't subscribed to, nor is it necessarily in my best interest given
that some parties sending unwanted communications may utilize the
unsubscribe request as a method of determining they are mailing a valid
address.

But the other 99,000 will never see that spam.  Evenly distributed, it means that an average user will only see 1% of spam.  That's not realistic, because not everyone will get the same spam, but the basic threshold can be adjusted.  At the very least, 30 people need to ""vote"" on a given piece of mail to make a realistic decision.  Since there's no ""no"" vote mechanism (except revocation--and that's after the fact), only a ""yes"" vote mechanism exists and so if you received 30 ""yes"" votes then you could safely say that you got a reasonable sample.

The system could pretend to have never seen the piece of mail until after it determined that it was probably spam.  So instead of a rating going up incrementally, it would take a big leap at the beginning (from undefined to a relatively high number) and then go from there.  So after the first group of people (our samplers, we'll say) have seen the spam, no one else would ever see it.

As far as unsubscribing, I'm always leery of clicking on the link (and don't do so unless I specifically remember signing up for something), but the sample population will decide for themselves whether they feel that it's spam.

So ultimately, I guess I'm saying that the most effective route would be to use a constantly changing sample pool and just accept that there is some fraction of users that will have to see the spam.  In a system that depends on people deciding whether or not something is spam, is there any other way?

And those would be????

Is there a point that you plan on releasing detailed information about
TeS, so we can stop engaging in idle speculation?

It's not my desire to second-guess you Vipul(however much my missives may
appear otherwise) or question the hard work you and the other
developers have put into the system, however it seems that every request
for such information has been met with silence.

RE: [Razor-users] Ricochet Question Actually,zeek <zeek@sparklehouse.com>,Sven Willenberger <sven@dmv.com>,"Wed, 14 Aug 2002 18:41:32 -0400","

formail did the trick. Thanks to those who answered. For the sake of
archives, here's how to ""patch"" ricochet:


1. procmailrc (/tmp/pmrc):

RICOCHET=/usr/local/etc/ricochet
PMDIR=/tmp
LOGFILE=$PMDIR/pmlog
VERBOSE=yes
MAILDIR=/tmp
LOGABSTRACT=all

:0 f
| /usr/local/bin/ri2


2. /usr/local/bin/ri2 (to test):

#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/ricochet -DONT_SEND >/tmp/rico.$$

3. formmail exec:

formail -ds procmail /tmp/pmrc </tmp/spm

-end-

Sorry for such brief instructions. The only problem here is that I get
another copy of the spam in the spambox again. This can be fixed with some
procmailrc tweaking (the "":0 f"" part).

Cheers,

I'm not sure that I follow your reasoning here. Razor isn't your mail 
server. It doesn't keep in your mail. You don't request your mail there. 
Nor do most people check for spam only when they are going to read their 
mail. My setup check a mail against Razor when my server receives it, 
not when I'm going to read it. If you wait to get 1000 reply for a mail, 
it means you have to wait for 1000 people to read it (at least, some 
people may not vote because they don't want to vote that day or because 
they don't think it's spam). Knowing that about half the planet would be 
sleeping (night time) and thus not reading their mail, it would mean 
that at least 2000 people already received the mail in their inbox. 
Knowing that, among the people who are not sleeping, not all of them are 
constantly reading their mail. I would say that less than 1 people over 
10 read their mail as soon as it arrives. That means that 20,000 people 
already recieved the mail and checked it against the Razor database 
before you would get your 1000 votes.

Also, with your system, 99% is the best you could get. If you wait for 
only one vote, maybe only 20 guy would read the mail (1 to vote, 10 
sleeping, and 9 not reading their mail soon enough). Wich gives a value 
99.98%. That's far better than your 99% don't you think.
In RealLife(tm), most likely one guy voting won't be enough but the 
thing is that it will stop the spam as early as possible.

Also, if for some reason, this mail is one of those people don't agree 
on whether it is spam or not, it would take a while to revoke those 1000 
reports, which means that some people may lose this legitimate (to them) 
mail.

You mentioned that with this system, people will re-report less often. 
First, I don't see how waiting *longer* before making a decision on the 
legitimacy of a mail will reduce re-reporting. The more you wait, the 
more people will get the mail in their inbox, the more people will see 
the mail (again, not everybody check their mail against Razor at read 
time, most do it a reception time using procmail/spamassassin). Second, 
re-reporting has its use, it increase the confidence that a mail is spam.

So I don't see what you gain with your 1000 people.

	Jehan

There are no plans for releasing details about TeS. Before the
release of Razor2, I'd pointed out that Razor2 backend (specially
TeS) will be closed.

Why do the details of the backend need to be open?

I don't think that Ebay publishes it's proprietary trust backend, why
should Razor?

[last message before I unsub]

It's a very poor comparison.

There is no question as to what Ebay's trust model is. It's
completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to
see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for
themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.

Contrast this with TeS which utilizes ""sooper secret"" methodologies to
determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point
something becomes spam at some level of ""confidence.""

The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly
ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about
a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,
apparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted
the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to
waste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to
a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.

Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO.

This isn't a MIME message that it is breaking down though.  The
message as sent to me is just a regular one part, non-MIME message.
The contents of the message among other things is a forwarded message
(inline not as an attachment) that happens to have MIME parts.

I see 1-4 documented in the manpage.  2 looked like a good candidate
but the manpage states that only 1, 3, and 4 are on by default.  No
mention of method 5 though that I can see.

I have to run off to a meeting but I'll send you a copy of the logs
and the message that triggered as SPAM when I get back.  I'll also
revoke it along with the other 3 similar messages and the Security
Advisory that were wrongly called SPAM this morning.

Thanks.

  Based on your description the whole thing would be 1 part.

  If your mail contains a fwd of a mail *inline* with mime boundaries, 
  then your mail is all consindered to be just text.  If you fwd
  the mail as attachment, the attachment is considered to be a separate
  part  - but the attachment is not broken down further for
  various reasons as mentioned before on this list.

  Its in the source code.

[WM] The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14),UW Email Robot <pine-robot@docserver.cac.washington.edu>,webmake-talk <webmake-talk@example.sourceforge.net>,"Mon, 19 Aug 2002 23:20:42 -0700","--------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is MIME?

MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the
standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending
images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. 

How can I read a MIME message?

Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)

In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
still hope! 

There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed
at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 

Does MIME replace UUENCODE?

Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the
message transformations made by certain email gateways. 

How can I learn more about MIME?

The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: 
                                                       
     o  US East Coast                            
        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        
                                                        
     o  US West Coast                            
        Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)

Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt

Another source of information is the Internet news group ""comp.mail.mime"",

The aggregator has been pushed back on the priority list because more
important things cropped up. I can't give you an ETA on it, but it's
very much on the TODO list.

cheers,

Speech at TTI Vanguard: ""Designing for Resiliency"" 
Conference

""911.net""

by Bruce Sterling

     Late last month I had the joy and privilege
of hanging out with a big crowd of American computer
scientists who were, basically, trying to find some 
reasons to live.

    Despite all evidence to the contrary, they've
definitely got some reasons.

    When you go to a conference which is very high-energy, 
with a lot of paradigmatic reassessment going on, where 
ideas are being flung around bodily well outside the box, 
well, that's an impressive thing.  But it's my principle 
as a sometime working journalist  not to get all carried 
away whenever I witness something like that.  They might 
well be drinking their own bathwater.  This sort of thing 
generally requires a reality check from some *other* 
conference. 

   So, I'm now fresh back from Colorado, from the yearly 
meeting of the High Ground Design Conversation.  These are 
my best pals in the industrial design world, some dear, 
long-time friends of mine, whose judgment I always trust.  
And why would a science fiction writer trust the judgment 
of industrial designers?  Well, because they're very 
*trendy.*  They're very shrewd,  and very stylish, and very 
hands-on people.  They're  peculiarly self-effacing and modest,
yet quite  imaginative.  Better yet, they're even practical.  
So they're kind of like science fiction writers, only with 
much better shoes.

    Usually when I go to this High Ground event, I just 
deliver some wacko chat about popular aspects of 
cyberculture and then I take some worshipful notes.  But!  
I have to report that when I took them my notes from the 
""CRA Grand Challenges in Computation"" conference, I was 
bringing the noise.

    This is the first time I have ever seen their jaws 
drop.  They're still kinda wringing their hands over the 
dotcom boom and the Ka-boom. They miss those glory days of 
the World Wide Web == because for them, that was the 
Graphic Designers Full Employment Act.  So they're pretty 
broke, and they're a little shell-shocked, so I guess they 
should join the club.  But  when I brought them *this* 
stuff == a rather extensively worked-out vision in 
worldbuilding from the point of view of ubiquitous 
computation in the 21st century...  Well, of course this 
is merely a scenario, but to me, ""911.net"" smells like the 
future.

     And frankly, it doesn't smell good.  But that's all 
right.  Because these aren't good times.  These are rather 
harsh, dark times, and in its own peculiar way, 911.net is 
a similarly harsh, dark concept.

    ""Ubiquitous computation"" is by no means a new idea.   
The guy who invented the term is dead, and even his R&D 
lab doesn't look all that great these days.  Ubicomp has 
been around for quite some time == in the table-napkin, 
handwaving stage.  But it's lacked the means, motive and 
opportunity to get any real-world traction.

   I believe that may be changing.  If so, it's mostly due 
to the events of September 11.  After that experience, 
ubicomp has got motive and opportunity as it never had 
before.  And the means, although they are still 
speculative, are starting to make some sense.

    What am I talking about when I use the term ""ubicomp""?  
Well, the term is a grab-bag, a congelation of different 
technologies.  Some are here, commercially available off 
the shelf; some are in the lab; and some may be physically 
impossible.

    Let's get down to some brass virtual tacks.  What are 
the key technical drivers for widely distributed, self-
organizing networks of sensors, processors and actuators, 
embedded in the physical world?  And what do you do with 
these things?

    Okay, number one:  fuel cells.  Not chemical 
batteries.  Small, portable, dependable, long-lasting, 
power sources with some punch.  They may not be fuel cells 
as they are now known.  They might be MEMS fuel cells, or 
aluminum-air cells, or something enzymatic, I don't care; 
just something much, much better than today's batteries.  
Portable power is the crux.  Ubicomp's  future, if it has one,
entirely hinges on this.  If we don't get some seriously 
advanced,  portable sources of power then everything I am 
about to tell you is a sci-fi phantasm. (Not that there's 
anything wrong with that!)

    Number two, RFID.  Radio-Frequency ID == gotta have 
some taggers.  Gotta be on the Net.  It'd be nice if they 
had some powered processors in them.  Something internal, 
pervasive, a little computational action that is going on 
inside physical objects.

    Number three, wireless broadband.  Getting real close 
here.

   Number four, dongles.  I think this part is seriously 
underappreciated.  This is the weird part of ubicomp, the 
part that may turn out to be its Achilles heel:  some way 
to turn the damn thing off.  And to *know* it's off.  The 
problem of the authorized user.  The authorized 
administrator, the authorized access.  This is likely to 
play out as ubicomp's functional equivalent of the 
Internet's intellectual-property problem.  In other words, 
it's a very serious issue which is going to be neglected 
from the get-go, as people are eagerly building the basic 
infrastructure.  Then, as they lamely try to build it in 
later, they are going to find out that they have 
inadvertently poisoned the water-stream for everybody.

    You don't want to wander into a Kazaa and Napster 
version of George Orwell.  Ubiquitous computation, unlike 
information, does not ""want to be free.""  This is not a 
technology of freedom. Ubiquitous computation wants to 
make you its slave. Try to remember that, for all our 
sakes, all right?  This is not a water-cooler for gossip, 
like the Internet is.  This is a hard-case, hard-times, 
hands-on, rather ruthless command-and-control system.

    Number five, GPS, global positioning systems.  Been 
there, done that.

    Number six, convoy traffic.  I think this is also 
underestimated, for when I started looking at serious 
applications for ubicomp, time and again, rapidly shipping 
large amounts of physical material in and out of the 
ubicomp zone is a killer application.  Getting stuff in, 
numbering it, assembling it, moving it out. Lots of it. 
Train loads, truck loads, bus loads. And airlifts.

    Bringing up the van, a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff, 
of varying degrees of use and practicality.  High speed 
fiber optic networks, check.  Massive storage and routers, 
check.  Big databases, check, but they need to be fast and 
flexible. Some ""MobiHoc"" action: mobile ad-hoc self-
assembling networks: networks that are always 
reconfiguring in real-time, always on the move.  

    Facial recognition has a considerable number of 
ubicomp applications, by no means all of them good.  Human 
presence-sensing systems?  Oh yes.  Ruggedized hardware 
suitable for outdoor deployment in all conditions and 
weathers.  Real-time simulation of ongoing major 
situations.  Toxin detectors of various kinds, 
environmental monitoring of almost every sort, biometric 
ID...  I have a long list of these.  I'm cross-checking 
them.  I'm using them to build scenarios.

    One thing about 911.net makes it very distinct from 
earlier visions of ubicomp.  This is not Microsoft Windows 
for Housekeeping.  This is a hard, tough web that you 
throw down fast over dire emergencies.  The key concept 
here is that we are finally moving computation out of the 
ivory tower, for good and all.  No more glass boxes of the 
1950s, no more clean abstractions of cyberspace.  We are 
deploying computation at unheard-of speed, into the 
darkest, dirtiest, most dangerous places in the world.

    It is a resilient security apparatus for emergencies. 
That is 911.net.  

    Now, you might well argue that ubicomp is very 
invasive of privacy.  That's just what my industrial 
design pals said about it, immediately, and they were 
right.  It's been hard to find reasonable deployments for 
ubicomp in peacetime commerce and in private homes, 
because it is so Orwellian. However.  Under certain 
circumstances, other social circumstances do trump this 
issue.

    For instance, when you are breathing your last under a 
pile of earthquake rubble, you don't really care much 
about privacy under your circumstances.  What you really 
want is  a smart bulldozer, a tourniquet, and some direct 
pressure against your open wounds.  And that is what 
911.net is about == or will be about, should it find its 
way out of the computer-science talking-shop and into 
daylight.  

     It is an emergency response system for the planet's 
open wounds.  And those wounds exist in plenty.  There are 
more of them all the time.

    I rather doubt that the Orwellian version of ubicomp 
has much of a future.  That's a scenario that I have 
dubbed ""Terrorspace"", which is ubicomp in the context of 
airports and nuclear power sites.  If you've been in 
airports recently, I believe you are seeing a pretty apt, 
early version of Terrorspace.  At any random moment, you 
can have your possessions rifled through by strangers.  
Your shoes are scanned, and various small but vital 
objects in your pockets can be confiscated by semi-
educated security geeks.  They're either pathetically 
under-trained for the job (in which case you certainly 
feel no safer), or else they are intelligent and capable 
people (in which case you pity them and wish they had some 
other job, for the sake of general human happiness and the 
GNP).  Rather than making us any safer, Terrorspace 
airports serve as political indoctrination centers that 
humiliate our voting population on a broad scale. They are 
meant to inure us to ever-escalating levels of 
governmental clumsiness and general harm.

    The difficulty with this Terrorspace approach is that 
airports and airlines are going broke.  Airports are 
hemorrhaging money trying to maintain this terrorspace 
apparatus.  It is likely to spread to the brittle power of 
nuclear power plants, nuclear waste dumps, bio-sites, 
chemical sites, liquid petroleum gas centers and so forth. 
That will hugely increase the overhead of all these 
dangerous industries. 

    That's a very considerable tax burden.  So, though 
Terrorspace may serve as a full employment program for the 
loyal and slightly stupid, that's not going to pay off 
socially or economically in the long run.

   However, 911.net is a different matter.   An air-
deployable 911.net that allowed first responders to 
rapidly deal with fires, floods and other major disasters 
would *save* money, especially for the insurers, who are 
already on the ropes.

    The actual September 11 event, 9/11, was a rare and 
remarkable thing.  And, with fewer than 3,000 people dead, 
it's just not that big a deal as genuine catastrophes go.  
Politically, theologically and militarily it was huge, but 
a workaday 911.net wouldn't fret much about terrorism.  
Instead, it would have to deal mostly with floods, fires, 
climate change, earthquakes, volcanoes and (let's hope 
never) asteroids and weapons of mass destruction.

   So, basically, with 911.net, we are describing a social 
re-definition of computer geeks as firemen.  Native 
twenty-first century computer geeks as muscular, with-it, 
first-responder types.  I think this would be pretty good 
for the computer industry.  We all need to take the 
dysfunctional physical world far more seriously.  This 
week, Italy's flooding, Texas is flooding, Colorado's on 
fire.  This morning, the brand-new wilderness forests 
around the site of the former Chernobyl are on fire, 
spewing radioactive ash hither and yon.   Chunks of 
Antarctica the size of Rhode Island have fallen into the 
sea. I could go on.

    This is the sort of activity that humanity is required 
to deal with in this new century. If we build a successful 
method with which to do this, those useful tactics will 
spread across the fabric of our civilization.  I believe 
they are already spreading.  An innovation like 911.net 
will likely serve as a camel's nose in the tent for a 
whole series of ubicomp applications across society.

    I've been speculating about these new forms of 
ubicomp, and giving them some flashy neologisms, because 
that is what science fiction writers bring to the table.  
We build little scenario worlds and make up names for 
them.  First we've got ""911.net,"" then ""Terrorspace,"" but 
there are others.

BATTLESPACE.  A term already much-used by the Pentagon.  
Battlespace means military C4ISR. The ""Revolution in 
Military Affairs.""  I would point out that the military, 
unlike some sectors, is not reneging on their enthusiastic 
commitment to the digital revolution.  On the contrary.  I 
haven't seen anybody in the military saying that they long 
to go back to the good-old-fashioned, solid, easy-to-
understand methods of the War in Vietnam.  The military 
are very into ""network-centric warfare,"" and they couldn't 
be happier about their spysats and surveillance drones.

PROSTHETIC UBICOMP.  This is eldercare.  A huge, steadily 
growing market. Alzheimer's disease is a flat-out domestic 
catastrophe that lasts seven years.  Any computational 
help here == in elder-proofing spaces, tracking the sick 
and so forth == would be of huge benefit to society.

CRADLE.NET.  Babies have no privacy.  Children have little 
privacy. Child-proofing a room against a crawling tot... 
if you've ever done this, you can realize how much use it 
might be to have this process automated.  Any two-year-old 
always wonders:  ""Why can't Mr Fork and Miss Wall Socket 
be friends?""  A real-time checklist, at the very least!  
And then we're faced with the interesting, large-scale 
prospects of ""K-12.net.""

STREET.NET.  This would be traffic management and urban 
systems management.  Water networks, power networks,
subways, sidewalks and so forth.

PUNISH.NET.  Two million people are in the American prison 
population.  They've got no privacy.  They've gotta be 
watched all the time.  They're basically crammed in iron 
cages now.

INDUSTRIAL UBICOMP. Managing supply chains, industrial 
assembly and so forth.  This will eventually be the 
biggest application.

SO/HO UBICOMP.  Ubicomp in the home, the home office and 
small office.  Some very interesting consumer uses here, 
but in the grand scheme of things, not that big a deal.

SAFETYSPACE.  These would be military bases, U.N. safety 
zones, refugee camps, and disaster evacuation centers.  
It's fairly easy to imagine ubiquitous computation as a 
sinister ""gated community"" that walls off privileged areas 
under threat.  But we can also think of it as importing 
some human comfort, solidarity, mercy and safety into 
various benighted areas that are severely disturbed.  One 
can imagine a Gorazde UN safe zone version of this, new 
and improved of course: a black helicopter ghosts over in 
the dead of night, deploys a scattering of small drones, 
smart-mines and sensors, and suddenly the war just stops 
within these bounds of Safetyspace.  Rapine, looting, 
sacking, smashing and burning are  ruled out of existence 
through computer awareness.  The handiness of a technique 
like that for life in the 21st century... well, it might 
be a bit underestimated.

And last, coming up with a bullet should the good times 
return in all their carefree glory:  UBITOPIA.  This I 
take to be ubicomp as an Urban Entertainment Destination.  
You go there for fun just because there is cool, wacky 
stuff embedded in the physical world, and it's behaving in 
a way that brings joy and hilarity and good spirits, like 
the funhouse mirror at a digital carnival.  

    When and if Ubitopia really hits, it will mean that 
humanity's basic relationship with our material goods has 
been radically redefined.  That is the apotheosis of 
ubiquitous computation. Just: material goods, and the way 
we deal with them, are different.  Different in character, 
different in quality.  Not recognizable by 20th century 
standards.

     So. I have no idea if the Homeland Security 
department, or FEMA or DARPA or the NSF, are going to pony 
up any money for any of these notions.  That's not my 
lookout.  I'm a science fiction writer.  And ladies and 
gentlemen, with this material, I have struck platinum.  
This stuff is really hot.  This is a great, attractive, 
contemporary idea that is really new, really different, 
and really ominous.  The implications are huge and they 
spread across the board of society. I am going to be a 
very busy guy with this material.  If you want to help me, 
send some email.

Thanks a lot for your attention.

""Cooler Tokyo summers may be just a pipe dream away
by Elaine Lies

JAPAN: August 5, 2002

   ""TOKYO == In what could be the ultimate in public works 
projects, a Japanese panel of experts has proposed 
relieving the misery of steamy Tokyo summers by cooling 
the huge city with sea water and a labyrinth of 
underground pipes. 

   ""Though summers are hard in any city, Tokyo's narrow 
streets, hordes of people and clusters of massive 
skyscrapers, largely unrelieved by greenery, produce a 
special brand of discomfort.

   ""And it gets worse every year.  (((Oh yeah.  You bet it 
does.))) The number of nights when temperatures stay above 
25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) in Tokyo has doubled over the 
last 30 years, while average temperatures have shot up by 
2.9 degrees C over the last century. Relief, however 
distant, could be on the way.  (((""Great news, weather 
sufferers!  We live in the high-tech capital of a G-7 
state!"")))

   ""At the behest of the Construction Ministry, the panel 
has drawn up a plan that would use a network of buried 
pipes, and water pumped from the sea, to cool things down. 
'In the very best conditions, certain areas could in 
theory become as much as 2.6 degrees Celsius cooler,' said 
Yujin Minobe, a ministry planner.

    ""The huge air-conditioning systems currently used to 
cool buildings get rid of the heat they take out of the 
structure by venting it into the outside air, raising 
temperatures still further and creating a 'heat island' 
phenomenon in large cities.  (((Soon whole *cities* will 
do it and vent their heat straight into the rising seas! 
Look out, Antarctica.)))

    ""Under the plan, this heat would be transferred to 
water in large underground tanks, and the water then 
pumped through a six-km (3.7-mile) network of underground 
pipes to a cooling plant on the Tokyo waterfront.

    ""There the heat from this water would be transferred 
to cooler sea water before the then-cooled water was 
pumped back through the underground pipes. The sea water, 
now warmed, would be released into the waters of Tokyo 
Bay.

    ""COSTLY PLAN.  (((That's unsurprising.)))  Minobe said 
the plan would cover some 123 hectares (304 acres) in the 
centre of Tokyo, including the Marunouchi business 
district and the posh Ginza shopping area, and would 
initially cost around 41 billion yen ($344 million).

    ""'Savings on reduced energy usage would eventually 
help pay for this,' he said.  (((A real nest of ironies 
here, folks.))) Officials quoted in the English-language 
Japan Times said energy savings would total more than 1 
billion yen a year, meaning the system would pay for 
itself in a bit over 30 years.

    ""However, Minobe said many problems remained with the 
plan, which has only been under discussion since April 
last year. One of the most serious problems is whether 
warmer water being returned to Tokyo Bay would damage the 
fragile marine ecosystem, a point Minobe said still 
required more study.  (((Give it 30 years and there won't 
be any ecosystem left to study.)))

    ""He said the average temperature cut is likely to be 
only around 0.4 degrees. 'I'm not even sure people would 
be able to feel that difference,' he said. Any such plan, 
however, would likely produce a gleam in the eyes of 
Japan's huge construction industry, known for its 
propensity for public works projects. Although several are 
decried as wasteful, public works projects have long been 
used by the government in attempts to stimulate the 
economy.  (((Nice use of the word ""attempts."")))

dream than anything else,"" Minobe said.

""Carbon dioxide turned into hydrocarbon fuel 
(((Please, no immediate lectures on the second law of 
thermodynamics. I have plenty of those.)))

""16:00�02�August�02

""A way to turn carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons has caused 
a big stir at an industrial chemistry conference in New 
Brunwick, New Jersey. Nakamichi Yamasaki of the Tokushima 
Industrial Technology Center in Japan says he has a 
process that makes propane and butane at relatively low 
temperatures and pressures.""

Link: Yes, he actually exists:
http://www.it.sakura.ne.jp/~koatsu/c_journal/ab/1_10/01-2.html
http://www.itc.pref.tokushima.jp/English/eindex.html

""Making fuel from greenhouse gases

""While his work still needs independent verification,  
(((okay, go fetch us some, then))) if he can make even 
heavier hydrocarbons, it might be possible to make petrol. 
It has carbon chains that are between five and 12 atoms 
long == butane is four atoms long.  (((""That's right, 
Professor: I just hook it up to the sky and I make 
gasoline!"")))

   ""The work suggests the tantalising prospect that CO2, 
the main greenhouse gas, could be recycled instead of 
being pumped into the atmosphere.

    ""Many people have tried before to make hydrocarbons by 
mixing carbon with hydrogen gas in a reaction chamber at 
very high temperatures, but yields have always been 
pitiful. Yamasaki has used hydrochloric acid as his source 
of hydrogen ions. (((""But where are we s'posed to get all 
that hydrochloric acid?"" Yes, I know, I know.)))

    ""He bubbles the CO2 into a reaction vessel where it is 
heated to about 300 C at 100 times atmospheric pressure. 
The heat and pressure are low enough, says Yamasaki, to 
make it feasible to scale up the reaction so it can run on 
a power station's waste heat. (((Imagine the fun when a 
giant tank of pressurized acid blows up.)))

""Iron powder 

   ""Using iron powder as a catalyst, Yamasaki says he has 
made substantial amounts of methane, ethane, propane and 
butane, which he was able to vent off as gases when the 
mixture cooled. If he can improve the catalyst's 
performance he is hopeful of making heavier hydrocarbons 
such as petrol, too. 

    ""William Siegfried, who has lead similar experiments 
at the University of Minnesota in the twin cities of 
Minneapolis and St Paul, says his group was only able to 
make methane at far higher temperatures. But his process 
also used a nickel-based alloy as a catalyst, rather than 
iron.

    ""Siegfried's group was investigating whether natural 
methane deposits might have formed chemically with the 
metal in rocks acting as a catalyst rather than forming 
from the decay of rotting biological material over aeons.  
(((Paging Thomas Gold! ""Deep Hot Biosphere"" calling on 
line one.)))

   ""Unless Yamasaki's technology can make the more 
valuable heavier hydrocarbons such as petroleum, which are 
liquid at room temperature, it will not be much more use 
than present-day bioreactors, in which bacteria that like 
to feed on CO2 are induced to produce methane. 'Organisms 
have a special talent for that kind of reaction,' says 
Siegfried.

""Germans discover ancient life, offer climate hope""
by Philip Blenkinsop 

GERMANY: August 12, 2002

""BERLIN == German scientists have discovered micro-
organisms deep under the sea that may provide an insight 
into some of the earth's first lifeforms and offer hope in 
the fight against global warming, the Max Planck Society 
said. 

    ""The marine biologists and geologists believe they 
have shown life could have existed by processing methane 
without the presence of oxygen.

    ""Their findings could also prove useful in ridding the 
earth of excess methane, one of the greenhouse gases many 
scientists believe is responsible for global warming.

    ""Traditional views of early life on earth centre on 
plants which converted carbon dioxide to oxygen.

     ""'These (plant lifeforms) date back to between three 
and 3.5 billion years ago... We have found biomass (large 
cluster of organisms) using methane that geologists show 
could have existed around four billion years ago,' 
Professor Antje Boetius, joint author of the study, told 
Reuters.

http://www.mpi-bremen.de/deutsch/biogeo/aboetius/aboetius.html

      ""The two-year research by the scientists from 
Hamburg University, the Alfred Wegener Institute in 
northern Bremerhaven and the Max Planck Society centred on 
coral-forming micro-organisms in the Black Sea at depths 
where no oxygen and no light is present.

     ""The Black Sea contains the largest oxygen-free basin 
in the world.

     ""The lifeforms were able to process methane together 
with sulphates within the water, producing carbonates, in 
the form of coral, as waste.  (((Black, oxygen-free 
""coral"".  I wonder what that stuff looks like.  Maybe you 
could make jewelry out of it.)))

     ""That they were able to do so without oxygen suggests 
they may have been around before plant life.

      ""'Perhaps micro-organisms like those found in the 
Black Sea were the original inhabitants of the earth 
during a long period of the earth's history,' said 
Boetius.  (((Yeah, they've just been sitting down there, 
waiting to save our bacon.)))

     ""She believes the findings could prove useful for 
climate control.

     ""Previously, scientists had thought that methane, 
found in abundance in the sea and produced through 
agriculture, could only be broken down with oxygen.

      ""The German researchers believe the discovery of a 
pool of organisms that process methane without oxygen 
could lead to a way of cutting down potentially harmful 
greenhouse gases without burning oxygen and producing 
similarly damaging carbon dioxide.  (((What do they 
*smell* like?)))

catastrophe,'"" Boetius said.

When a Crop Becomes King
By MICHAEL POLLAN

CORNWALL BRIDGE, Conn. -- Here in southern New England the corn is
already waist high and growing so avidly you can almost hear the creak
of stalk and leaf as the plants stretch toward the sun. The ears of
sweet corn are just starting to show up on local farm stands,
inaugurating one of the ceremonies of an American summer. These days the
nation's nearly 80 million-acre field of corn rolls across the
countryside like a second great lawn, but this wholesome, all-American
image obscures a decidedly more dubious reality.

Like the tulip, the apple and the potato, zea mays (the botanical name
for both sweet and feed corn) has evolved with humans over the past
10,000 years or so in the great dance of species we call domestication.
The plant gratifies human needs, in exchange for which humans expand the
plant's habitat, moving its genes all over the world and remaking the
land (clearing trees, plowing the ground, protecting it from its
enemies) so it might thrive.

Corn, by making itself tasty and nutritious, got itself noticed by
Christopher Columbus, who helped expand its range from the New World to
Europe and beyond. Today corn is the world's most widely planted cereal
crop. But nowhere have humans done quite as much to advance the
interests of this plant as in North America, where zea mays has
insinuated itself into our landscape, our food system and our federal
budget.

One need look no further than the $190 billion farm bill President Bush
signed last month to wonder whose interests are really being served
here. Under the 10-year program, taxpayers will pay farmers $4 billion a
year to grow ever more corn, this despite the fact that we struggle to
get rid of the surplus the plant already produces. The average bushel of
corn (56 pounds) sells for about $2 today; it costs farmers more than $3
to grow it. But rather than design a program that would encourage
farmers to plant less corn which would have the benefit of lifting the
price farmers receive for it Congress has decided instead to subsidize
corn by the bushel, thereby insuring that zea mays dominion over its
125,000-square mile American habitat will go unchallenged.

At first blush this subsidy might look like a handout for farmers, but
really it's a form of welfare for the plant itself -- and for all those
economic interests that profit from its overproduction: the processors,
factory farms, and the soft drink and snack makers that rely on cheap
corn. For zea mays has triumphed by making itself indispensable not to
farmers (whom it is swiftly and surely bankrupting) but to the Archer
Daniels Midlands, Tysons and Coca-Colas of the world.

Our entire food supply has undergone a process of ""cornification"" in
recent years, without our even noticing it. That's because, unlike in
Mexico, where a corn-based diet has been the norm for centuries, in the
United States most of the corn we consume is invisible, having been
heavily processed or passed through food animals before it reaches us.
Most of the animals we eat (chickens, pigs and cows) today subsist on a
diet of corn, regardless of whether it is good for them. In the case of
beef cattle, which evolved to eat grass, a corn diet wreaks havoc on
their digestive system, making it necessary to feed them antibiotics to
stave off illness and infection. Even farm-raised salmon are being bred
to tolerate corn  not a food their evolution has prepared them for. Why
feed fish corn? Because it's the cheapest thing you can feed any animal,
thanks to federal subsidies. But even with more than half of the 10
billion bushels of corn produced annually being fed to animals, there is
plenty left over. So companies like A.D.M., Cargill and ConAgra have
figured ingenious new ways to dispose of it, turning it into everything
from ethanol to Vitamin C and biodegradable plastics.

By far the best strategy for keeping zea mays in business has been the
development of high-fructose corn syrup, which has all but pushed sugar
aside. Since the 1980's, most soft drink manufacturers have switched
from sugar to corn sweeteners, as have most snack makers. Nearly 10
percent of the calories Americans consume now come from corn sweeteners;
the figure is 20 percent for many children. Add to that all the
corn-based animal protein (corn-fed beef, chicken and pork) and the corn
qua corn (chips, muffins, sweet corn) and you have a plant that has
become one of nature's greatest success stories, by turning us (along
with several other equally unwitting species) into an expanding race of
corn eaters.

So why begrudge corn its phenomenal success? Isn't this the way
domestication is supposed to work?

The problem in corn's case is that we're sacrificing the health of both
our bodies and the environment by growing and eating so much of it.
Though we're only beginning to understand what our cornified food system
is doing to our health, there's cause for concern. It's probably no
coincidence that the wholesale switch to corn sweeteners in the 1980's
marks the beginning of the epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in
this country. Sweetness became so cheap that soft drink makers, rather
than lower their prices, super-sized their serving portions and
marketing budgets. Thousands of new sweetened snack foods hit the
market, and the amount of fructose in our diets soared.

This would be bad enough for the American waistline, but there's also
preliminary research suggesting that high-fructose corn syrup is
metabolized differently than other sugars, making it potentially more
harmful. A recent study at the University of Minnesota found that a diet
high in fructose (as compared to glucose) elevates triglyceride levels
in men shortly after eating, a phenomenon that has been linked to an
increased risk of obesity and heart disease. Little is known about the
health effects of eating animals that have themselves eaten so much
corn, but in the case of cattle, researchers have found that corn-fed
beef is higher in saturated fats than grass-fed beef.

We know a lot more about what 80 million acres of corn is doing to the
health of our environment: serious and lasting damage. Modern corn
hybrids are the greediest of plants, demanding more nitrogen fertilizer
than any other crop. Corn requires more pesticide than any other food
crop. Runoff from these chemicals finds its way into the groundwater
and, in the Midwestern corn belt, into the Mississippi River, which
carries it to the Gulf of Mexico, where it has already killed off marine
life in a 12,000 square mile area.

To produce the chemicals we apply to our cornfields takes vast amounts
of oil and natural gas. (Nitrogen fertilizer is made from natural gas,
pesticides from oil.) America's corn crop might look like a sustainable,
solar-powered system for producing food, but it is actually a huge,
inefficient, polluting machine that guzzles fossil fuel -- a half a
gallon of it for every bushel.

So it seems corn has indeed become king. We have given it more of our
land than any other plant, an area more than twice the size of New York
State. To keep it well fed and safe from predators we douse it with
chemicals that poison our water and deepen our dependence on foreign
oil. And then in order to dispose of all the corn this cracked system
has produced, we eat it as fast as we can in as many ways as we can
turning the fat of the land into, well, fat. One has to wonder whether
corn hasn't at last succeeded in domesticating us.

                               life-long pursuits

         On July 17th, 2001, DMITRY SKLYAROV, coder for the Russian
         software house ELCOMSOFT, was arrested while visiting the
         US. His crime: writing code that exposed flaws in Adobe's
         e-book security, in contravention of the USA's exciting new
         DMCA. In the next year, thanks to widespread protests, Adobe
         withdrew their call to prosecute the Russian hacker and
         Dmitry was freed. Elcomsoft is still in the dock for
         breaching Adobe's copy restriction routines. If the aim of
         the prosecution was to cow them into keeping quiet about
         security problems, it doesn't appear to have worked. On July
         12th, 2002, ELCOMSOFT posted to Bugtraq a flaw in Adobe's
         e-book security. Namely, that in Adobe's ""lending library""
         web app for the Adobe Content Server, you can borrow a book
         for over twenty years (instead of three days) just by
         changing a hidden Web form value. The library site is just a
         demonstration app, so it's not a serious problem, but it
         does give Elcomsoft room for a catty little addendum. ""Some
         time ago"", they write ""we have found much more serious
         problem with another Adobe software and reported it to the
         vendor; however, there was no response at all, and so we
         decided not to waste our time reporting this one (about the
         library) to Adobe"". How much reaction do they want?

         We'll tread cautiously with this one, as it involves Vast
         Ageless Corporations Who Have Retained Counsel Living Where
         Their Glowing Eyesockets Used To Be. Just days before we
         read on Slashdot that zombie company FORGENT is demanding
         patent license fees for users of JPEG, we're contacted by
         someone who has received a similiarly threatening letter -
         this time, from the rather more established Lucent
         Technologies. The message reads: ""After some market research
         it has come to our attention that some of your company's
         products may employ the JBIG/JPEG Standard. Therefore,
         Lucent Technologies GRL LLC, Lucent's licensing agent, is
         contacting your company regarding your interest in obtaining
         a license for patents."" What follows is the usual demand for
         fees, dire threats if compliance is thwarted, requests that
         the guards seize the criminals and throw them in Patent
         Dungeon, etc. Now, Lucent's patents don't seem to be
         breached by a JPEG implementaton (although it's known that
         JBIG is patent-encumbered; hence JBIG-2). So why does Lucent

         Oh, is it time again already for Esquire's 50 Sharpest Men
         2002? Joy! Hidden among the usual suspects - which include
         Richard Dawkins (""scientist""), Kevin Warwick (""scientist""),
         Kevin Eldon (""comedian"" - and KING OF HOBBIES), is one 
         Charlie Brooker (listed here as a ""TV Go Home""). Merely 
         appearing in the list seems to have prompted the reclusive,
         unsmiling, and often violent comedian to hurredly post a 
         TVGoHome update from his pile of cardboard boxes near Soho,
         which is all to the good. But does he really deserve the title?
         What *is* sharpness? ""In case your are [sic] in any doubt"", 
         the site explains, ""sharpness is, above all, an attitude"". Now
         the dictionary says it's also ""having a bitter taste"", and
         ""harshness of manner"", and given that Hank, the Angry
         Drunken Dwarf is both unlisted and dead, we think Brooker's
         a show-in for the Web protest/mess-with-publisher's-heads
         vote. We urge you to vote now, express the will of the
         people, and win some vile perfume or a horrible watch.

         And yet, at the same time, we cannot look away. 7pm local

         EVENT (check local listings for details, free), attracting - 
         at time of writing - an impressive 91 interested signups for 
         the London gathering (19 for Manchester, Leeds 17, Glasgow 11, 
         Birmingham 9, Liverpool 6, and so on). Usual warnings about 
         meeting your online ""friends"" are, we imagine, more than 
         usually applicable here - especially as no-one can work out 
         what the organisers are getting out of it. Spamming lists? 
         Kickbacks from the democratically selected venues? Or valuable 
         demographic info like the fact that ""Elijah Wood"" is currently 
         more popular in hobbit-friendly Glasgow than U2, Tori Amos, or

         In response to complaints from last year, ""middle class BBC
         Micro Fauntleroys"" will be permitted, says last year's
         judge, Matt Westcott. More weakness is shown by permitting
         Atari 2600s, which have 2K cartridges, to enter (you must
         fill the last 1K with zeros), and also the TI99/4A which as
         everyone knows has sixteen bits. We do hope this doesn't end

[VulnWatch] Geeklog XSS and CRLF Injection,Ulf Harnhammar <ulfh@update.uu.se>,bugtraq@securityfocus.com,"Fri, 19 Jul 2002 02:23:52 +0200","Geeklog XSS and CRLF Injection


PROGRAM: Geeklog
VENDOR: Tony Bibbs et al. <geeklog-devel@example.sourceforge.net>
HOMEPAGE: http://geeklog.sourceforge.net/
VULNERABLE VERSIONS: 1.3.5sr1, possibly earlier versions as well
NOT VULNERABLE VERSIONS: 1.3.5sr2
LOGIN REQUIRED: no
SEVERITY: high


DESCRIPTION:

""Geeklog is a 'blog', otherwise known as a Weblog. It allows
you to create your own virtual community area, complete with user
administration, story posting, messaging, comments, polls, calendar,
weblinks, and more! It can run on many different operating systems,
and uses PHP4 and MySQL.""

(direct quote from the program's homepage)

Geeklog is published under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.


SECURITY HOLES:

1) Geeklog has got an XSS hole that affects both the stories and
the comments. The program removes the HTML elements that are used
for scripting, but it fails to remove the HTML attributes that are
used for the same purpose, which leads to this hole.

One example of an XSS attack would be:

<b onMouseOver=""self.location.href='http://localhost/geeklog/'"">life
has made her that much bolder now</b>

When a victim moves the mouse pointer over the quote from ""Lady
Godiva's Operation"", an intrinsic event occurs and the JavaScript
code is executed.

(There is also an XSS issue in the search engine. It was reported
by §ome1, and not by me.)

2) Geeklog has got a CRLF Injection hole in User Profile: Send
Email. The users' mail addresses are meant to be secret, but by
using this hole, you can get someone's mail address anyway.

The problem is that you can add extra mail headers, by using a
CRLF combination followed by an extra mail header in the Subject
field. One way to add them is saving the HTML document with the
form, and changing the <input type=text name=subject> tag to a
textarea. After opening the edited document in a web browser, you
enter a Subject line in the textarea, press Enter, and then you
enter your extra mail header. When the mail is sent, that header
will be included. If the header in question is ""Bcc: <your own
mail address>"", the message will silently be copied to you, thus
revealing the recipient's mail address without them knowing.

I have described this type of problem in further detail
in my ""CRLF Injection"" paper, which is available at
http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/2002/05/msg00079.html


COMMUNICATION WITH VENDOR:

The vendor was contacted on the 1st of July. Version 1.3.5sr2,
which does not have any of these security holes (neither mine nor
§ome1's), was released on the 9th of July.


RECOMMENDATION:

I recommend that all administrators upgrade to version 1.3.5sr2.

The problem with the ""SPAM: "" prefix, is that it's required for
spamassassin -d (removing SpamAssassin markup) to work correctly.

JPEGs patented,harley@argote.ch,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Fri, 19 Jul 2002 18:11:36 +0200","------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A video conferencing company based in Austin, Texas says it's going to

And it's already found a licensee: Sony Corporation.

Formerly known as VTEL, Forgent Networks acquired Compression Labs in

filed in 1986 but Compression Labs never pursued royalties.

Hi, Matthias,

You should temporarly remove gentoo 0.11.29 from valhalla.freshrpms.net.
This build (and 0.11.28) has a strong bug: Problems with copying ""deep""
directories.

Have reported this to Emil, he looks currently into it, a fix should be
available soon..

Sorry

It seems reasonable to have a configurable minimum below which
spamassassin flattens the test to zero (turning it off): by default set
to zero; but if you set it to say 0.01, spamassassin would ignore tests
with scores -0.01<0<0.01 (trading accuracy for time).

The overkill variant of this feature would have scores scored by (score
* relative-time-taken) with relative-time-taken computed over a large
corpus (probably Craig's ;} ). Then you could specify a minimum value of
*that* parameter to flatten at, giving assurances that you're killing
only tests that are expensive for their utility.

Unfortunately I can't think of a good name for that parameter.

I can whip up a patch if anyone thinks this is any use.

I think I found the bug that caused this.  However, since I couldn't make it 
happen every single time, I may have just been lucky since I made my change.  
At any rate, the change I just made is clearly more correct than what was 
there before.

Let me know if I'm mistaken.

Folder computed replcomps (and replgroupcomps,J C Lawrence <claw@kanga.nu>,exmh-users@spamassassin.taint.org,"Fri, 19 Jul 2002 18:51:39 -0700","
Is there a relatively clean way to dynamically build comp files based on
the path of the current folder?

  Yeah, I know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the
  current folder to the mail root, but that's not what I want.

I'm starting to use plus addressing heavily as part of my SPAM controls.
Specifically I each mailing list with a list-specific address.

  eg I would subscribe to this list as claw+exmh@kanga.nu or perhaps
  claw+exmh-users@kanga.nu instead of claw@kanga.nu

However to do this I need a new set of comp files for each list folder.
As I'm subscribed to something just over 600 lists, that's rather a
pain.  I really don't want to go create and maintain ~1,800 comp files
(components, replcomps, replgroupcomps), especially not as I suspect
I'll be changing or adapting my naming pattern a few times as I adapt
various supporting tools.

What would be great is if I could build the relevant comp file
dynamically at runtime.  That way I don't need to maintain a couple
thousand comp files, I just need to make my plus addresses
predictable/computable based (say) on the folder path.

  eg I'm currently in folder:

    +-Lists-/Products/Exmh-L

    The script would dynamically build a compfile which had a From: of
    claw+exmh@kanga.nu for repl, comp, etc.

  Similarly when in folder:

    +-Lists-/Linux/SVLUG-L

  I'd get a From: of claw+svlug@kanga.nu

That way I can use lookup tables for those folders which have multiple
lists being delivered into them.

Any ideas how this might be done in an automatic/maintainable fashion?
It would be more than good enough if all I had to do was drop a tiny
FROM_HEADER file in each folder that somehow got picked up by the comp
file...

I can tell you what the 'clear' and 'del' arguments mean:

Mh_SequenceUpdate lists/l-k clear cur {} public
	This means to clear the 'cur' sequence for lists/l-k

Mh_SequenceUpdate lists/l-k del unseen 5400 public
	This means to delete message 5400 from the 'unseen' sequence for lists/l-k

Can you explain more what you were actually doing as this occurred?  This 
doesn't appear to be background processing.  Is there significance to message 
5400?  Is it the one that isn't displaying?

After sending the report I started fiddling with the Ftoc_RescanLine 
stuff and I havn't seen it since. I can't really tell if it was my 
hacking that removed it, or if it was some transitional magic 
happening since this was the first invocation of that version of 
exmh. I've backed out my stuff now, and'll let you know if it happens 
again.


On another thing with the Ftoc_RescanLine stuff. This routine is 
called at times still unclar to me. An inspection of the routine 
suggests that it is used in the transition of a message to/form 
""current"" state to re-paint the ftoc line. However, checking the 
msg.tcl code (MSgChange) we find:

    if {$msgid != {}} {
        # Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line 
instead
        if {$msgid < 0}  return
    } else {
        # line null too, try using first in folder
        if {[string length $line] == 0} { set line 1 }
        set msgid [Ftoc_MsgNumber [Ftoc_FindMsg $msgid $line]]
    }
    Ftoc_ClearCurrent
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msgid
    Ftoc_ShowSequences $exmh(folder)

The Ftoc_ClearCurrent calls Ftoc_RescanLIne to clear the '+' sign 
_before_ the on-disk transition is made. I hacked this stuff and more 
or less changed the order. It works, but fails on some folder changes.

My feeling of this is that we really do not want to have a 
Ftoc_ClearCurrent, but rather just a RescanLine and the caller had 
better know the line or msgid. That routine shoud just put in the '+' 
if the line/msg in question happened to be the cur msg. Thoughts?

Intuitively, that sounds right to me.  It does also call ""tag remove"", so 
you'll have to make sure that gets set correctly as well.

I think any changes that make it behave more intuitively are a good thing even 
if they mean we have something else to fix.  Of course, that attitude is why 
I've been fixing exmh bugs for 3 weeks.

Unfortunately, there are few comments in this part of the code.  I haven't 
been helping that situation much, although there are some comments in the new 
sequence stuff that I wrote.  I have cleaned up a bit of code so that 
it's a little more clear what it's doing and a little less delicate.  I also 
gratuitously renamed some variables for clarity.

My last few bug fixes were purely problems that I created in my own 
patches and I can't blame anyone but myself.

As I'm avoiding real work, I may clean up a little bit more (and probably 
break a few things as well ;-).

I just checked in a code cleanup which doesn't address this issue, but does 
take a machete to code right around it.  You ought to 'cvs update' and see if 
your issue becomes any clearer with all the brush removed.

My patch notes that 'msgid' and 'line' are redundant with one another and removes 
one or the other from functions which takes both.  The callers are then 
changed to pass what the function expects.  In the case of Msg_Change, the 
'line' argument is removed and we only have the msgid argument.  Ftoc_ClearCurrent
is now the first line of MsgChange.

I have a version that's working now. I'll try it a couple of days and 
check it during daylight. Basically I added an agument to 
ClearCurrent and updated all callers to slap in $ftoc(curLine). I 
also flipped the order in  Msg_Change to ClearCurrent $prevline after 
the Mh_SetCur. For some reason it barfs when Marking many messages 
Unread. I'll check that tomorrow.

G'night.

Look at my friend Jonathan's company, VOXEO.  Unless you're going

TellMe & BeVocal have off-the-shelf services that do this, though,

If I were to build this I'd spec a lightweight IMAP client and

Ballmer in charge 
July 18, 2002 1:01 pm PT

NO ONE KNOWS better than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that, as the .Net
platform evolves, the success of Microsoft depends on how well the
company coordinates its tool, server, and client strategies and how well
it communicates that vision. In an interview with InfoWorld Test Center
Director Steve Gillmor and InfoWorld Editor at Large Ed Scannell at
Microsoft Fusion 2002, Ballmer discussed the progress of .Net, changes
in the company's approach to product development, and Microsoft's
efforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and
partners.

> Last time we talked was two years ago, at the beginning of the .Net
> era. So where are we now in the .Net evolution?

Let me start by talking about where I think we are in the XML revolution
first, and then [I will] talk about where we are with .Net. I believe
that the IT industry collectively decided over the last three or four
years that the world was going to be replatformed with XML as the key
foundation. It's not like anyone ever got together to decide this, but
it's like magnetic north, where it's been clearly indicated that
everyone is rallying around the concept. But I think the degree to which
[XML] is pervasive might still be underestimated. A lot of partners,
even at this conference, see it as b-to-b for big companies. But it is
really about the way software in general is designed. It is all about
the way security should work. Management -- everything is changed.

So to answer your direct question, two years ago I might have said the
jury is still out about whether [XML] was going to happen. We were
questioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to Java. But
now the world has decided to embrace [XML] as the basis for the next
generation of technology. And there are a lot of benefits that come with
it. Could it have been something other than XML? Sure it could have. It
wasn't the specific technical implementation; it is merely the fact that
it comes out of Internet standards. It has deeper semantic abilities. It
is all about interoperability and connection.

So in that context, where are we with .Net? I'll say a couple
things. No. 1, I would say we have some momentum in the market. We have
customers using the .Net product line, like Merrill [Lynch], Credit
Suisse, Marks & Spencer, CitiBank, and a variety of others. People who
are doing some things for real. I feel like the degree we are out front
is in some ways smaller and in some ways larger.

> How so?

Smaller in the sense that everyone is talking the XML talk, even Sun;
bigger in the execution sense: We've delivered. We delivered the first
batch of products that really were built XML to the core -- Visual
Studio .Net and BizTalk Server -- and we are getting traction. So I feel
good about where our execution is relative to everyone else. That is not
to say that other people aren't doing some reasonable bolt-on XML
support for the stuff they have.

> You have some heavy lifting to do to convince your customers and
> partners to follow along. What do you have to do to set the standard
> for adoption and upgrading to this next generation?

We have to present the picture that we are behaving consistently within
the framework of focusing on customer issues and customer satisfaction
and trustworthy computing, which we have articulated. Now there are some
things I would have done differently, in 20-20 hindsight. I would have
increased the focus on not just security but deployment, because a lot
of the security problems are actually deployment problems. We have the
fix, but sometimes we can't get the tools in their hands to deploy those
fixes fast enough. Licensing -- I know I would have given more time, and
there are better ways to plan around the kinds of changes we made. We
are still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications.

> Do you expect any changes to be made between now and July 31 to
> Licensing 6.0? There is a lot of push-back on this.

No, there is nothing that will happen between now and July 31. And we
will continue to learn over time what we need to do to earn our
customers' trust and earn their business. I think many of the people who
are pushing back really don't even know the new terms.

> Isn't that your fault for not educating them?

Yes, it is our fault. But you meet with plenty of customers whose
companies already have licenses, and they are saying, 'I think there's a
problem.' I don't deny there are some problems. I am sure there are some
issues we will have to work on over time.

After July 31 we are going to see what the real issues are. I was
talking to a customer at the show who was saying he thought there would
be a problem, and I told him that we just completed a deal with his
company and that he is now universally licensed and that total costs to
his company are now lower than they were before. And he said, 'Oh really?'

So we'll go through July 31. We have a lot of customers who have signed
licenses, and I am sure we are going to find some issues. My bigger
concerns today are probably not in the larger accounts, but there may be
some issues we need to address among the smaller-size companies, and we will.

> How does the .Net initiative change the way in-house client and server
> developers work together? 

What we are trying to do for the health of .Net and the health of the
company and the sanity of the people who work there and the quality of
the products we produce is to have a more orchestrated, �ber-road map
of where we are going.

Now there are two things a road map can be. One is just a piece of paper
that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom-up
plans. Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision
from the top. We are not going to try to get everything shared. ...
That's a path for getting everything stopped up. But at the same time we
are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in
the Longhorn wave, Yukon wave, or the .Net wave and really have enough
time to have some cross-cutting discussions about how we make that happen.

Bill [Gates] is dedicated full-time to being chief software
architect. He also happens to be chairman of the company, but he spends
most of his time being chief software architect. We have a body now that
meets every month -- the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team],
basically the top people involved in the product-creating strategy --
and we present and discuss the issues. Bill is driving a process for
each of these waves. For instance, [he will ask] what are the
cross-cutting scenarios that I want, and then [he will] get all the

to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other
people in the company. And from Bill's perspective, [this framework] is
the technical road map and the SLTT process; it is the scenarios. From
my perspective, it is the P&L [profit and loss] structure and the
multiple businesses because, given how we work, giving people a
framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the
parts will mean we have better offerings.

> It seems the scenarios construct is really working for you. Is this an
> evolution of the solutions approach? 

I would say it is a pretty direct extrapolation from the solutions
stuff, only I think we are just getting a little more experience. I
think we use the word scenarios more often and solutions less, because
solution sounds more like a fixed thing. At the end of the day, most of
the things we do are customizable and programmable, and so people make
them into the solution they want. But they are still scenarios. What
will software deployment look like? Well, that is a scenario because it
involves Windows, Office, and other applications.

We are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the
parts. That's not to say people are always comfortable with this. I
can't even say we will do it perfectly. All we have to do is do it a lot
better than we had been doing it. I think that would be a big step
forward for the customers.

> Will this approach cut down on some of the technology civil wars
> Microsoft has had in the past involving who is going to gain control of
> a project? This seems to be a very democratic approach to development.

I would not use the word democracy to describe it. People have to come
together and ultimately make some decisions. This is not a voting
process here, the agenda of what we think is important. We get a lot of
input. [But] once it is decided, people don't get to vote with their feet.

We try to make a quantum leap here in terms of our ability to improve
pulling together all the pieces. Our customers want us to do
that. Simplifying concepts by unifying them. The customers don't say
they want us to do that, but when we do do that, they go, 'Ahhh, I get
it. That makes sense.'

I don't want to go to six more meetings where people say, 'Is your
workflow strategy BizTalk?' ... Or 'What's your Office workflow
strategy?' Or 'Why is synchronization in some ways better for e-mail and
Outlook than it is for file folders and Web pages?'

To get that sort of synchronization sometimes -- to get that high-level
road map to work -- you have to build something we don't have today. So
we have been talking about unifying storage. And so the best way to get
all this stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way. Then you
just keep tuning one set of parameters instead of having a thousand
flowers blooming.

> In your Fusion keynote today, you talked about who your competitors
> are, and it was the usual suspects. But one you didn't mention is
> yourself. You are competing against the last generation of your technology.

Always. Given that our stuff doesn't wear out or break down -- you can
question whether it breaks or not [Ballmer grins] -- but it doesn't
break down like machinery does. To get anyone to do something new, we
have to have something interesting and innovative.

People think, OK, should we just do more upgrades or try to sell more
new product? We decided that users like us to do a level of systems
integration so they don't have to get involved in that. So take
Sharepoint Team Services, which we put in Office. We could have sold
Team Services as a separate product, and we could have introduced a new
SKU [stock keeping unit]. We could have decided if it should work down
level with the old Office or just the new version of Office, and we
could do that with real-time communications. But we tend to like to put
things together, integrate them, and then release batches?1202?-- which
are then 'upgrades' -- as a form of introducing our new innovation. But
no matter how you do it, because our stuff does not wear out, we have to
convince people that some idea we have is better or more powerful than
the older idea we had.

And there are two aspects of doing that. One aspect is, on a given
product or upgrade release, does that make sense? Or do we convince you
that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innovation that
you will want to be licensed for that innovation. And this is part of
this whole licensing discussion we are having.

We moved to the new licensing for two reasons, I would say. No. 1, we
wanted to simplify our licensing. When we look back a year from now, I
guarantee you that where we are now is simpler than where we
were. Nothing is simpler during a transition because they are learning
the new and are more familiar with the old, but I think people will
eventually realize this is simpler. Our licensing got pretty complicated
over the years, and some people came to not understand it all.

The other issue is [the timing of delivering] our innovation. I don't
want to have a lot of rough questions [from customers]. So when we do
have new ideas, it's like, OK, should we put it in this upgrade or that
one or just have a stream of stuff that only our best customers have
access to under the terms of their contract? I think in the long run we
have a better chance of satisfying them with the latter than with
hitting them with six different upgrades. I am a fan of [letting] the
customer decide, OK, I want that piece or this piece. But they are
licensed for all of it. So those are the two things we sought to do.

The truth is, we need to be better at both. There are some things you
can only do big and lumpy, like a new file system. It's not like some
sort of small user feature; if you change the file system, then the
storage, the backup, probaby those things are going to change. Probably
the shell ought to change.The applications ... a lot of things are going
to change. Can you call that lumpy? Or you can put out four new features
in PowerPoint, sure -- that would not look lumpy to users.

I think we have to build trust in the model, and we are going to have to
deliver more over time. It will not come overnight. People will have to
see that we do a few things, ... that not all of our innovation is
lumpy, that more of it comes evenly and steadily. People develop a
confidence and faith; they like both aspects of the model. Over time,
our support needs to become more intimately involved in that story.

We know that, but we don't know exactly what that means yet. And this
whole notion of software as a service -- this is not a licensing or
business discussion. It's how does software get rearchitected in the
world of the Internet? I mean, how many software products are
fundamentally different because of the Internet? Not many. Probably the
anti-virus guys keep up the best. They are always feeding new virus
support in. I asked the audience [at Fusion] how many use Windows
Update. Now that's a small piece of software, but it is big. That's the
consumer market; we've got to get that to really purr in the corporate market.

The No. 1 thing is, we have to make software that is so compelling that
people will start saying, 'Well, of course I am going to get broadband.'

> And 802.11 is one of those compelling features?

Yes, it is. I was in a hotel in Sun Valley, [Utah], this week that was
not wired. So I turned on my PC, and XP tells me there is a wireless
network available. So I connect to something called Mountaineer. Well, I
don't know what that is. But I have a VPN into Microsoft; it worked. I
don't know whose broadband I used. I didn't see it in Bill's room. I
called him up and said, 'Hey, come over to my room.' So soon everyone is
there and connecting to the Internet through my room.

We have to support all the modalities, whether it is GPRS [General
Packet Radio Service] or 802.11. We have to make it easy to provision
from a software perspective for things that go on with DSL [and] cable
modems. ... And the software has to want a broadband link. There are not
many things you do where you say I really care about the performance. If
I am downloading PowerPoint files, then I want broadband. So when you
can do things with speed that you otherwise can't do without speed, that
is going to put a lot of pressure on the broadband community.

That's the weird answer. The more normal answer is, yeah, isn't it
awful: There is not enough broadband, and the prices they charge ... . I
agree with all that. If you look at what happened in Japan recently,
there was a big drop -- it is now $25 a month for DSL. Vroom. They have
gone from almost no DSL connections a year ago to 1.5 [million] or 1.8
million [subscribers].

> So how do we make that happen in this country?

I think that is beyond us. If there is enough interest where the
consumers are looking intensely for broadband, whether it is at today's
prices or tomorrow's prices, that is going to shake out the
marketplace. And I think the marketplace will do a good job. We just
have to make it something obvious that consumers want. Now I happen to
live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network. No DSL or
cable modems. Well, I have a neighbor, [Teledesic chairman and co-CEO]
Craig McCaw, who has a wireless network that I think I can piggyback off
of [Ballmer laughs]. So, yes, broadband is a bottleneck -- but I also
think we have to look at oursleves as a software industry and say,
'Aren't we, too, some of that bottleneck?' We have not built software

aDaM@XeNT.CoM -- long .sig alert!



I believe it is quite possible to productively apply both supposedly
incompatible approaches [REST & SOAP] together.  I'll sketch it out
below, both in prescriptive form.  Note: while this is proscriptive, it
is expected that local adaptations will be provided.

1. Start by modeling the persistent resources that you wish to expose.
By persistent resources, I am referring to entities that have a typical
life expectancy of days or greater.  Ensure that each instance has a
unique URL.  When possible, assign meaningful names to resources.

2. Whenever possible, provide a default XML representation for each
representation.  Unlike traditional object oriented programming
languages where there is a unique getter per property, typically there
will be a single representation of the entire instance.  These
representations will often contain XLinks (a.k.a. pointers or
references) to other instances.

3. Now add high level methods which take care of all composite create,
update, and delete operations.  A key aspect of the design is that
messages for these operations need to be self contained - both the
sender and receiver should be able to make the absolute minimum of
assumptions as to the other's state, and multiple requests should not be
required to implement a single logical operation.  All requests should
provide the appearance of being executed atomically.

4. Query operations deserve special consideration.  A general purpose
XML syntax should be provided in every case.  In addition, when a
reasonable expectation exists that query parameters will be of a
relatively short size and not require significant encoding, then a HTTP
GET with the parameters encoded as a query string should also be
provided.

Implications  

The following table emphasizes how this unified approach differs from
the ""pure"" (albeit hypothetical) different positions described above.

1. Resource -- POST operations explicitly have the possibility of
modifying multiple resources.  PUT and DELETE operations are rarely
used, if ever.  GETs may contain query arguments.

2. Get -- GETs must never be used for operations which observably change
the state of the recipient.  POST should be used instead.

3. Message -- Do not presume that URLs are static, instead presume that
they identify the resource.  In particular, recognize that URLs can be
dynamically generated.  Expect URLs of other SOAP Resources in
responses.  Use the SOAP Response MEP for pure retrieval operations.

4. Procedure -- Treat the URL itself as the implicit first parameter.
Allow URLs to be dynamically generated, and returned in structures.  Use
HTTP GET for retrieval operations.

Conclusions  

Looking to the future, the application level inter-networking protocols
that emerge today will likely be the application level intra-networking
protocols of the next decade.  Both REST and SOAP contain features that
the others lack.  Most significantly:

REST - SOAP = XLink

The key bit of functionality that SOAP applications miss today is the
ability to link together resources.  SOAP 1.2 makes significant progress
in addressing this.  Hopefully WSDL 1.2 will complete this important work.

SOAP - REST = Stored Procedures

Looking at how other large scale systems cope with updates provides some
key insights into productive areas for future research with respect to REST.

Finally, it bears repeating.  Just because a service is using HTTP GET,
doesn't mean that it is REST.  If you are encoding parameters on the
URL, you are probably making an RPC request of a service, not retrieving
the representation of a resource.  It is worth reading Roy Fielding's
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0181.html> thoughts
on the subject.  The only exception to this rule that is routinely
condoned within the REST crowd is queries.

Iconoclast designers choose MIPS
By Anthony Cataldo
May 28, 2002  

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A group of engineers in Calabasas Hills, CA wants to
turn the microprocessor world on its head by doing the unthinkable:
tossing out the clock and letting the signals move about unencumbered.
For those designers, inspired by research conducted at nearby Caltech,
clocks are for wimps.

The Fulcrum Microsystems Inc. design team isn't the first to propose an
asynchronous processor, but president and chief executive officer Robert
Nunn wants to be the first to take a clockless, fire-breathing processor
mainstream. ""We really deal with an asynchronous world,"" he said. ""We
only make it synchronous for our own convenience.""

This is the kind of stuff that many in the processor industry would
consider lunatic fringe, too weird for conservative embedded-systems
designers. But the young processor company and more than a dozen others
like it are anchored in the mainstream courtesy of the MIPS
instruction-set architecture. More and more, MIPS is becoming the choice
for maverick processor design teams seeking a place at the high end by
fielding unorthodox devices. And if Motorola and IBM in the PowerPC camp
aren't careful, they could see their performance leadership in the
high-end embedded-processor market snatched away by some of these upstarts.

In Austin, Texas, meanwhile, designers at another MIPS house, Intrinsity
Inc., aren't prepared to ditch the clock. But they are putting a new
spin on some old tricks such as giving each gate its own clock and then
letting them overlap. Using such sleight of hand, the company hopes to
soon deliver RISC-based processors that run at an eye-popping 2 GHz and
consume just 10 to 15 watts.

Fulcrum, Intrinsity and their brethren may once have been written off as
interesting experiments, backed by venture capitalists who overlooked
some of the finer details, like software compatibility. What lends them
respectability is MIPS.

Theirs for the asking 

One reason young processor companies seem to be flocking to the platform
is that its steward, MIPS Technologies Inc., has no qualms about
licensing the instruction-set architecture (ISA), provided that the
licensee agrees to meet a software-compatibility test suite. By
contrast, processor-core rival ARM Ltd. has granted this privilege to
just two of its many licensees, Intel and Motorola. And so far, the two
PowerPC vendors, IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc., have rebuffed most
requests to license that architecture, with the notable exception being
FPGA vendor Xilinx Inc., which has licensed the 405 PowerPC from IBM.

The MIPS ISA is also one of the simplest forms of
reduced-instruction-set computing around, which tends to make it
attractive to processor designers interested in extending the
architecture. It was this and the wide availability of tools and
software that drew Intrinsity to MIPS, even though the company is aiming
at PowerPC sockets, as evidenced by its decision to adopt the RapidIO
interface instead of HyperTransport, which has been favored by MIPS vendors.

Good fit 

""It's a nice, clean architecture and has an open model that allows us to
add instructions,"" said Paul Nixon, chief executive officer of
Intrinsity.  ""You also get all the third-party tools that very easily
fit into our base of platforms.""

There was a time when this openness was seen as a liability for MIPS. In
the mid-1990s, before MIPS was spun out from Silicon Graphics Inc., the
instruction set lacked a multiply-add instruction, so some MIPS vendors
took it upon themselves to create their own. The problem was that this
broke many of the development tools, causing headaches for compiler
vendors like Green Hills Software Inc.

""We went to MIPS and said we have 20 different compiler variants and
it's embarrassing,"" said Craig Franklin, vice president of engineering
at Green Hills and a respected microprocessor industry veteran. Franklin
also wasn't shy about telling MIPS it needed to revamp its embedded
application binary interface. ""We went to MIPS and said we've done a
dozen EABIs, let's clean up yours,"" he said.

MIPS took the advice and wasted little time clamping down on
architectural deviations, observers said. But the MIPS camp still has to
live with a legacy of incompatible chips in the field. ""To its credit,
MIPS quickly caught on,"" said Jim Turley, a microprocessor industry
analyst. ""Going forward, MIPS is maintaining good control but they are
still haunted by incompatibility among multiples.""

If the biggest risk to the MIPS camp is fragmentation, then the PowerPC
camp has the opposite problem: architectural confinement. Though the
PowerPC architecture carries the cachet of household names Motorola and
IBM, these are essentially the only two companies that provide
PowerPCs. It's not for lack of interest. Rather, the companies have been
reluctant to cede control over the architecture. This could wind up
hurting the PowerPC cause, though.

""To get a PowerPC license is impossible or very expensive,"" Green Hills'
Franklin said. ""Tactically this may have been a mistake. If you're a
Japanese company, all things being equal, you'd rather buy from another
Japanese company.""

Analyst Turley, too, thinks the PowerPC camp will only stand to gain by
licensing the architecture. ""It's all about software compatibility and
tool support. The more you can proliferate the architecture the better
you're going to do,"" he said. ""I don't think Motorola and IBM can
address the entire market by themselves.""

There's a chance that this could change. IBM, for its part, is in the
process of planning an expansion strategy for PowerPC that may involve
more licensing. Though it's unlikely the PowerPC camp will ever have the
open licensing model of MIPS Technologies, MIPS processor vendors may
have more than just two competitors to worry about.

""We're certainly not averse to [licensing],"" said Lisa Su, director of
PowerPC products at IBM. ""The question is, how much do we do and who do
we license to. There are various ways you could go, whether it's a hard
core, soft core or licensing the ISA.""

But the fear of architectural fragmentation still looms large. ""We know
that if we have different microarchitectures we have to do work on
software compatibility,"" Su said. ""With MIPS there's a degree of
fracturing. That may not always be a big problem, but if you go to other
markets -- like consumer -- it becomes big. Our belief is there is a
happy medium.""

Whatever path IBM takes it will act in its own best interest as a chip
provider, not as a company that wants to hawk intellectual
property. This is why the Xilinx licensing deal works for IBM: Big Blue
is not so much interested in the royalties and fees it collects from
Xilinx, but in the dual benefit of widening the appeal of the
architecture and the revenue IBM generates from manufacturing the FPGAs
for Xilinx in its own fabs. ""We're not trying to make money off of
licensing,"" Su said.

Manufacturing is probably one of the most powerful weapons that PowerPC
vendors IBM and Motorola wield. Both have gussied up their high-end
lines with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insulator technology,
still rarities among chip makers. This has helped both companies design
relatively low-power embedded processors running at 1 GHz that are
shipping today. IBM did it using 0.13-micron design rules and a
four-stage pipeline; Motorola is using 0.18-micron design rules and a
seven-stage pipe.

The companies say there's more performance headroom in store. ""When we
get to 0.13 micron we'll get substantially faster,"" said Raj Handa,
PowerPC and PowerQuicc marketing manager at Motorola.

Proprietary processes 

Most MIPS processor vendors, by contrast, rely on mainstream foundries
that haven't developed the more-exotic process technologies. And even
though companies like Motorola are shifting more capacity to outside
foundries, they're keeping their special process recipes in-house to
juice up their high-performance devices.

Lacking this capability, most MIPS processor vendors will have little
choice but to come up with dazzling architectural feats to keep up their
chops at the high end. It should become clear in the next year or so how
some of the newer players measure up.

Intrinsity hopes to field its 2-GHz processors by the end of the
year. Fulcrum is shooting for an early 2003 introduction. ""We're going
to shock the industry in terms of raw performance and speed-vs.-power
performance,"" Fulcrum's Nunn said. ""We really want to change the way the
world designs semiconductors.""

The Pasadena startup machine
By Alison Overholt
April, 2002  

There was a time when every dorm room, it seemed, was a startup waiting
to happen. Throughout the 1990s, kids cobbled together business plans
between classes, won funding, and jumped into business. Risk? What risk?
Plunging into a new venture seemed all too easy.

Ah, the fickleness of youth. These days, most of the kids are back in
class. Venture capitalists say that they're seeing precious few
proposals out of MIT, Stanford, and almost every other university, save
one: the California Institute of Technology.

In fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of
startups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as
it did in the boom year of 1999. While startup enthusiasm has faded on
most campuses, Caltech has blossomed into a robust new-company machine.

This didn't happen by accident. During the past seven years, Caltech's
Office of Technology Transfer has carefully developed a strategy for
cultivating commerce. ""We focus on nurturing entrepreneurs
scientifically more than other schools do,"" says Rich Wolfe, the
office's associate director. That is, the university focuses more on the
science itself than on the ensuing commercial opportunity.

That's what grabbed Uri Cummings and Andrew Lines, two PhD students at
Caltech who founded Fulcrum Microsystems in 2000. ""There is a pervasive
philosophy at Caltech that no problem is unsolvable,"" Cummings
says. ""There's a focus on scientific ingenuity that is thrilling to be
around. Caltech has so many entrepreneurs because the school doesn't
make it about business or focus on how much money they'll get out of
it. Caltech is a catalyst, moving technology from the university out
into industry, and students are thrilled to be a part of it.""

Before starting Fulcrum, Cummings and Lines worked for six years with
Caltech computer-science professor Alain Martin on an
asynchronous-circuit design for semiconductor chips. They ventured into
commercialization while still in the throes of their doctoral program.

That they could afford to do that points to another, more practical
aspect to Caltech's approach. Other universities typically require
entrepreneurs to pay up-front application and licensing fees for the use
of technology patents. But Caltech believes that such payments stifle
entrepreneurship, since young companies usually have little cash to
spare. Instead, the school typically takes equity stakes in startups,
and it defers collection of patent payments until fledgling companies
are financially secure.

For Caltech, it's a long-term bet. ""The reality is that universities
rely far more on their endowments than they could on any fees to be
collected from the initial licensing process,"" Wolfe says. ""So we seek a
bite of the apple -- and we hope that if one of these entrepreneurs
founds the next Intel, he'll not only share the equity but also bestow a
gift on the university in remembrance that we took care of him when he
was just getting started.""

Cummings and Lines may be in a position to do just that. Fulcrum has won
about $20 million in venture funding amid the toughest venture market in
recent history. Its founders have hired a credible CEO, Bob Nunn, who
formerly ran Vitesse's telecom division, and hired 24 top students from
their alma mater. And they've garnered rave reviews of their chip design
from technology journals.

One thing that Cummings and Lines haven't done yet: finished their
degrees. Officially, both are now ""on leave."" They may not be back.

High-tech startups fail for only three reasons: stupidity, luck, and greed. 

Tip one for would-be entrepreneurs: Avoid stupid and unlucky people. If
you are stupid or have bad luck, don't start a high-tech business.

Tip two for would-be entrepreneurs: Do a product that you want to do,
not one that they want you to do.

Startup founders generally have only ideas, charisma, and equity to work
with. Ideas and charisma are cheap, but equity is expensive.  To make a
start-up work, the founder has to divvy out parts of the business at
just the right rate to keep everyone happy until the product is a
success. Give away too much of your company too soon to a venture
capitalist, to your co-workers, or even to yourself, and you risk
running out of distributable shares before the product is done. And that
probably means the product won't be done. Ever.

Tip three for would-be entrepreneurs: Don't take venture funding too soon. 

If you are doing a software product, don't take venture money until you
need it to introduce the product.  Don't take venture money until you
have used up all of your own money, your mother-in-law's money, and
everything you can borrow.

Bootstrap. Rent, don't buy. Don't hire people to do things you can
contract out because contractors don't require stock options.

As the founder, the man or woman with the grand plan, your function is
to manage the distribution of your own holdings so that you end up with
fewer shares but more wealth.

Tip four for would-be entrepreneurs: Invite me to lunch. I'm a cheap date.

RealNetworks Poses Challenge to Microsoft
By JOHN MARKOFF

SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 -- In a significant challenge to Microsoft,
RealNetworks plans to announce a new version of its software on Monday
that can distribute audio and video in a range of formats, including
Microsoft's own proprietary Windows Media.

The new software is intended for large media companies and other
corporations that need to send audio and video data to customers and
employees in a variety of different formats. But RealNetworks
acknowledged that it was possible that the company might incur
Microsoft's legal wrath.

Nevertheless, Rob Glaser, a former Microsoft executive who founded
RealNetworks as Progressive Networks in 1994, said he believed the
strategy was good for both Microsoft and consumers.

""A rational way for them to respond would be to say, `This is great,' ""
he said. ""That would be Microsoft of the future.""

Mr. Glaser said his company, based in Seattle, had developed a version
of the Microsoft Media Server software that comes with the Windows
operating system.

He said RealNetworks' engineers had studied the data that was sent
between the Microsoft media server software and the Windows Media Player
program and recreated the technology needed to play files in the
Microsoft format. This method created a so-called clean-room version,
meaning the developers built the transmission software without any
knowledge about the underlying program.

Microsoft has adopted a similar strategy at several junctures,
Mr. Glaser said, reverse-engineering technologies like NetWare,
PostScript and JavaScript at different times.

Microsoft executives said the company currently licensed the Windows
Media Player technology to a variety of companies including Yahoo,
RealNetworks and the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner. But a
Microsoft executive said that a clean-room copy of the Windows server
technology could lead to quality and performance issues.

""It's kind of hard to speculate about the technology until we see it,""
said Dave Fester, the general manager of the Windows Media division. If
a company has not licensed the server software, he added, ""we would need
to look at it and see what they're doing.""

RealNetworks appears to be endeavoring to avoid being ""Netscaped,"" a
reference to the fate that befell the Netscape Communications
Corporation when Microsoft decided to make an Internet browser, which
was pioneered commercially by Netscape, a standard part of the Windows
operating system. Netscape was later acquired by AOL Time
Warner. Microsoft's decision to build an Internet browser into Windows
and give it away at no additional cost led directly to a bitter
antitrust lawsuit brought by the Justice Department in 1997.

RealNetworks, which was a pioneer in the market for streaming media to
desktop personal computers, has been under growing pressure from
Microsoft, which is giving away both the server and Windows Media Player
program as part of its operating strategy. RealNetworks also faces
challenges from Apple Computer, which offers the QuickTime media player
as a part of its Macintosh OS X operating system and sells a more
full-featured player.

Moreover, in recent months Macromedia Inc., which makes the Flash
animation software used on many Web sites, has added video capabilities
to its technology, making it a potential rival.

RealNetworks is gambling that with a proliferation of different
standards and formats for video and audio, the media corporations that
make content available over the Internet will flock to a single system
that supports multiple types of data. The company is trying to shift the
focus of the competition from the PC desktop to the server, according to
analysts.

Several analysts said the RealNetworks shift in strategy could put
Microsoft on the defensive.

""Real has got the experience and sophistication to pull this off,"" said
Richard Doherty, the president of Envisioneering, a market research and
consulting firm based in Seaford, N.Y. ""It will open up a new horse race.""

Until now the companies have been engaged in a technology war to rapidly
increase the power and quality of each of their media players. At the
same time, they have competed over which of the programs are placed on
the desktops of personal computer users. RealNetworks claims to have
700,000 subscribers for pay services, but it is perceived as being
increasingly vulnerable, according to some analysts, because Microsoft
has included its Media Player as part of the Windows operating system,
which dominates the PC market.

There are dozens of data formats for playing audio and video on the
Internet, but the dominant ones are RealAudio and RealVideo from
RealNetworks, QuickTime from Apple, Windows Media from Microsoft and the
industry digital movie standards MPEG-2 and MPEG-4.

Microsoft and RealNetworks are currently locked in a close race for
desktop media player leadership. In the first quarter of this year,
according to survey data collected by Jupiter Research, a market
research firm based in New York, RealNetworks' RealOne Player had a 29.1
percent share of media players, while Microsoft's Windows Media Player
had a 28.2 percent share. Apple's Quicktime player was third, with a
12.2 percent.

The new server software from RealNetworks is part of a version of the
company's media server that is to be introduced on Monday and which will
be called the Helix Universal Server. RealNetworks said it would offer
performance data based on a test it financed at an independent testing
service, KeyLabs, that indicate that the Helix software can, under some
conditions, deliver up to four times the speed of the Windows Media
Server in Microsoft's operating system. (Software servers are programs
that run on powerful computers and can send streams of digital
information to many computer users simultaneously.)

At a news conference scheduled to be held in San Francisco, RealNetworks
is also expected to announce that it plans to make the Helix software
available as part of a strategy known as community source, which will
make it possible for RealNetworks partners and competitors to take
advantage of the original programmers' instructions.

RealNetworks is to announce a range of partners, including Hitachi,
Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Deutsche Telekom, NEC, Nokia, Cisco Systems,
Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Palm, Texas Instruments and others. These
partners could then incorporate the software into their own hardware and
software products.

Under the licensing strategy, companies will be able to freely gain
access to the underlying code that the Helix program is based on, but
they will still pay a licensing fee when they sell commercial products
based on the technology.

The community-source approach to software, which was pioneered by Sun to
distribute its Java programming language, is a variation upon the
original free software or open-source approach which has confounded the
software industry in recent years.

While open-source software can be freely shared, with some restrictions,
the community-source approach is more restrictive and yet still tries to
persuade others to collaborate and add innovative ideas.

Other large technology companies including Sun, I.B.M. and Apple, have
all now adopted variations on such open-source strategy, with varying
results. In Sun's case, the company has been criticized because, while
Java has become an industry standard, the company has not been the
principal financial beneficiary in many cases.

RealNetworks is trying to strike a balance between opening up its
technology to persuade others to participate and innovate and not losing
control of the technology entirely, Mr. Glaser said. ""We think we've
struck the balance well,"" he said.

Analysts said the strategy shift by RealNetworks was likely to shake up
the industry. ""The moment you've open-sourced something you've cornered
your competitor,"" said Matthew Berk, an analyst a Jupiter Research. ""To
date this stuff has been very proprietary. Opening it up makes it
accessible to creative and gifted programmers who will come up with wild
stuff that the companies have never considered.""

Mr. Glaser said he expected other companies to produce technology that
would rival RealNetworks' commercially as a result of the
community-source strategy.

One possibility is that companies such as Sun or I.B.M. could decide to
add the Helix technology of RealNetworks as a standard component of
their operating systems. Although RealNetworks might not get a
significant financial benefit from such an arrangement it could
contribute to making its Helix software a de facto industry standard.

Mr. Glaser said he had struck upon the idea of making his media server
software open source while visiting with an executive from Nokia, the
world's largest cellphone maker.

""Taking all of this stuff beyond the PC has been a huge motivation for
us,"" he said. When he realized that Nokia was interested in deploying
the software technology on as many as 30 to 40 different types of
phones, he realized that RealNetworks did not have enough programming
talent to support the effort.

""I told him, `I don't think we have enough engineers even if you guys
were willing to pay us,' "" he said.

That touched off a search for an alternative way of having the two
companies cooperate.

Real takes the open-source route 
By Jim Hu 
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
July 22, 2002, 1:55 PM PT

RealNetworks on Monday unveiled a new open-source version of its
streaming media technology that supports multiple file formats for audio
and video, including those that use Microsoft's Windows Media technology. 

The new campaign, dubbed ""Helix,"" and first reported by The New York
Times, marks one of the most ambitious moves in the company's
history. RealNetworks is simultaneously releasing technology without
permission that plugs in to Microsoft's competing software and is
raising the hood on much of its own software technology to ""open source""
developers or anyone else who wants to look. 

The twin moves raise the risk of lawsuits and renewed competition --
potentially even from Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft itself, once it
gets a look under the hood at RealNetworks' technology. But it marks a
dramatic, potential way for a company watching its market share diminish
to regain momentum and support across an industry where many other
players remain skeptical of Microsoft's power.

""It's a very bold move on the part of Real,"" said Michael Gartenberg, a
research director for analyst firm Jupiter Research. ""This was a shot
fired by Real and fired directly at Redmond."" 

The move is the latest in a series of strategic twists and turns that
has made RealNetworks one of the only companies to survive direct
Microsoft competition for years. While the company has expanded into
paid subscription content business, its software and streaming media
infrastructures have been under increasing pressure from Microsoft,
which has deemed multimedia to be one of the major drives under the
latest versions of its Windows operating system. 

Real's Helix announcement mainly involves the technology that allows
media files to move from place to place over the Internet. RealNetworks
and Microsoft both produce servers that allow video and audio to be
streamed from a content company such as CNN or NBC to a personal
computer. Real has charged for this software, while Microsoft has given
it away for free. 

In April, RealMedia reached 17 million at-home viewers, compared with
Windows Media at 15.1 million and Apple Computer's QuickTime at 7.3
million, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. At work, Windows Media drew
about 12.2 million unique viewers, compared with RealMedia's 11.6
million and QuickTime's 5 million. 

Real's own new product, called the Universal Server, will allow one
server to stream Real's technology, Microsoft files, Apple Computer's
QuickTime, and others. Most other competing products do not support
competitors' technology. 

""When you have all these different platforms, and all these different
protocols, it gets unmanageable,"" RealNetworks' Rob Glaser said at a
high-glitz press conference in San Francisco announcing the product. ""A
lot of what (this technology) is about is breaking those bottlenecks and
making convergence really converge."" 

To make the new product compatible with Microsoft files, however, the
company pursued a risky strategy known as ""reverse engineering,"" in
which developers examine a competitor's product to see how it works and
try to create something that works just like it. 

Glaser said that engineers worked entirely in a ""clean room""
environment, meaning that they had no access to actual Microsoft
code. Had they simply copied code, they could be liable for patent
infringement. The resulting product simply mimics the way that
Microsoft's files are sent across networks and allows a Windows Media
player to receive the file. 

Other companies have been sued for simply copying a competitor's code
and putting it in their own products. But RealNetworks says it's not
worried about Microsoft lawsuits, because it took precautions to do all
development in the ""clean room"" environment. Microsoft itself has
engaged in this kind of legal reverse engineering. 

Analysts say Microsoft, which still faces antitrust lawsuits, is in no
position to sue in any case. 

""This is a very tenuous time for Microsoft,"" Gartenberg said. ""This is
not a time in Microsoft's history when it can be seen as trying to do to
Real what it did to Netscape."" 

The influential giant?

Certainly, Monday's announcement acknowledges Microsoft's influence in
media technology, something Glaser and Real have often been loathe to do. 

Microsoft was quick to spin Monday's announcement as further validation
of its strength in the marketplace. 

""It's an admission of RealNetworks that it's important for them to
support Windows Media and that we're now the leading player among home
and work users,"" said Michael Aldridge, lead product manager for
Microsoft's Windows Digital Media division. 

Aldridge added that RealNetworks currently has a licensing agreement for
its media player to support Windows audio and video formats. However,
RealNetworks and Microsoft do not have an agreement to allow the server
to deliver Windows Media formats to end users, which is what
RealNetworks trying to do. 

Aldridge declined to comment on RealNetworks' replication of Microsoft's
technology. 

In addition to its own new product, Real has promised to give away
source code to much of the underlying technology for streaming
media. That stops short of the actual file format, or ""codec"" itself,
but will provide the open-source community and other companies with
powerful new tools to build their own streaming media players or
software. 

Glaser said he wouldn't initially make the software code that mimics
Microsoft's streaming available but that he was considering the idea. A
first chunk of code underlying the RealNetworks multimedia player
software will be released in 90 days. Other code, including the basic
functions of its streaming media server and encoder, will be released by
the end of the year, the company said. 

The company's plan to reveal its source code--the basic instructions
underlying the software--echoes similar moves made by Netscape
Communications to defend against Microsoft. In March 1998, Netscape took
the bold step of opening its source code to allow software developers to
help create the next generation of its popular browser. 

James Barksdale, then CEO of Netscape, said the move would allow the
company to ""tap into a virtually unlimited developer talent pool.""
Instead, the effort, which has evolved into the Mozilla.org project, hit
considerable roadblocks, and Microsoft overtook Netscape in market
share.

The problem with SOAP is that it tries to escape from the Web interface.
It deliberately attempts to suck, mostly because it is deliberately
trying to supplant CGI-like applications rather than Web-like
applications.  It is simply a waste of time for folks to say that ""HTTP
allows this because I've seen it used by this common CGI script.""  If we
thought that sucky CGI scripts were the basis for good Web
architectures, then we wouldn't have needed a Gateway Interface to
implement them.  In order for SOAP-ng to succeed as a Web protocol, it
needs to start behaving like it is part of the Web.  That means, among
other things, that it should stop trying to encapsulate all sorts of
actions under an object-specific interface.  It needs to limit its
object-specific behavior to those situations in which object-specific
behavior is actually desirable.  If it does not do so, then it is not
using URI as the basis for resource identification, and therefore it is
no more part of the Web than SMTP.

A quick Google search turns up:

Darwin streaming media server

http://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/index.php
MPEG4IP: Open Source, Open Standards, Open Streaming

MPEG4IP provides an end-to-end system to explore MPEG-4 multimedia. The
package includes many existing open source packages and the ""glue"" to
integrate them together. This is a tool for streaming video and audio that
is standards-oriented and free from proprietary protocols and extensions.

Provided are an MPEG-4 AAC audio encoder, an MP3 encoder, two MPEG-4 video
encoders, an MP4 file creator and hinter, an IETF standards-based streaming
server, and an MPEG-4 player that can both stream and playback from local
file.

Our development is focused on the Linux platform, and has been ported to
Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, BSD/OS and Mac OS X, but it should be relatively
straight-forward to use on other platforms. Many of the included packages
are multi-platform already.


Both sound interesting, and low $$.

The following patch removes Ftoc_RescanLine in favour of a 
Ftoc_RescanLines. It runs scan(1) on a list of lines and updates ftoc 
accordingly. The patch also changes all the callers to make use of it.

It also changes Ftoc_ClearCurrent to work of an argument instead of 
falsily clearing a message that's still Current on disk. All in an 
effort to get a one-to-one disk-display correspondence.

It does add ~30 -- ~ 75 ms (~<10%) to the execution time depending on 
folder size due to the invocation of scan. However this version does 
not try to second guess the mh version of scan so if you have exotic 
scanlines it tells the truth. As a side effect the '+' sign now 
corresponds better to what's on disk.

Comments appreciated. I'm going to be offlike for a couple of days, 
so I send the cvs diff rather than putting it in the cvs.

with most end users completely oblivious to AOL's actions.

America Online Scales Back Instant-Messaging Compatibility Efforts
Updated: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 01:23 PM ET

Dow Jones Newswires

NEW YORK -- America Online appears to be scaling back efforts to make its
instant-messaging service compatible with rival services.

The unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. (AOL, news, msgs) said in a regulatory
filing it is now focusing on messaging interoperability methods that are
more limited in scope than the kind envisioned by the Federal Communications
Commission when it approved the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001.

America Online isn't required to make its messaging system interoperable
with others, but the FCC's merger approval included what it considered to be
incentives for the company to do so. It also required AOL to file progress
reports on its interoperability efforts every six months. The most recent
report, filed last week, disclosed the company's new direction.

The upshot of the strategy shift is that the instant-messaging market isn't
much closer to broad-based interoperability than it was 18 months ago,
according to industry analysts. Unlike e-mail, users of most competing
instant-messaging services still can't directly trade messages. So an
America Online instant- messaging user can't communicate with a user of
Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT, news, msgs) MSN Messenger, except by using
third-party software such as Trillian.

America Online, the biggest instant-messaging provider, has been criticized
for blocking users of rival services from gaining access to its users. The
company also has been accused of dragging its feet amid industry attempts at
interoperability.

For its part, America Online has said it wants to protect the security of
its users and the reliability of its system. And it points out that other
companies have so far failed to agree on interoperability standards.

When the FCC approved the AOL-Time Warner merger, it said that if America
Online wanted to offer video-conferencing and other advanced
instant-messaging features over Time Warner's cable lines, it first had to
enable its instant- messaging users to communicate with users of rival
services. The intent of the condition was to prevent America Online from
widening its dominance of the instant-messaging market by exploiting its
access to Time Warner cable systems.

AOL hasn't yet introduced video features, even though rivals Microsoft and
Yahoo Inc. (YHOO, news, msgs) did so last year.

Specifically, the FCC said America Online would have to implement a
technology known as ""server-to-server interoperability"" before it could
offer video. The technology would allow users of non-America Online services
to detect when AOL users are online, and to trade messages. It would do so
via communications between the computer servers operated by each messaging
provider, using a common language.

But in the progress report filed with the FCC last week, America Online said
it will ""focus its efforts"" on alternatives to server-to-server
interoperability. They are more limited in scope than server-to-sever.

As an example of an alternative, America Online cited a recent agreement to
make its instant-messaging service compatible with a new messaging service
from Apple Computer Corp. (AAPL, news, msgs). The Apple service, IChat, will
be included in Mac OS X 10.2, the new Apple operating system set for release
in August.

IChat users will be able to talk to America Online users, but it won't
involve server-to-server interoperability. Instead, the actual exchange of
messages will occur only on America Online's servers, even as IChat
customers use Apple software.

""We believe this kind of hosted IM solution provides, at least in the short
term, a secure, reliable and cost-effective means to provide
interoperability between AOL, IM and unaffiliated IM communities,"" Steven
Teplitz, AOL's associate general counsel, wrote in the progress report to
the FCC.

As to the apparent change in strategy, company spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan
said Tuesday: ""It's a recognition that server-to-server has proven a hard
nut to crack for the entire industry."" Indeed, users of America Online's
rival services can't directly communicate with each other, either.

The alternative solution ""was something that we could implement now to
provide for IM communities to communicate,"" said Ms. McKiernan, adding
America Online would explore partnerships with other messaging providers,
similar to the Apple deal. None has been announced so far.

FCC officials couldn't be reached Tuesday.

America Online hasn't ruled out the possibility that it would someday
implement server-to-server interoperability. The company has explored the
technology in the past, including a server-to-server last year with Lotus
Development, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM, news,
msgs).

But America Online's interoperability test with Lotus was ""limited in scope
and functionality."" True server-to-server technology ""would require further
significant expenditures of time and resources to develop,"" wrote Mr.
Teplitz.

The Internet Engineering Task Force, a group devoted to developing Internet
standards, has been working on a server-to-server messaging technology but
hasn't yet developed a final version, according to America Online. Task
force representatives couldn't be reached.

The company's strategy shift means that true interoperability in instant
messaging is still a couple of years away, according to Michael Gartenberg,
analyst with Jupiter Research.

""It's still something the market wants,"" he said. ""At some point, it'll
happen, but maybe a couple of years down the road.""

Mr. Gartenberg and other analysts believe America Online hasn't actively
pursued true interoperability because it wants to protect its large user
base. If messaging systems were compatible, the company could lose ground
because prospective customers might see no difference in choosing another
provider, as long as they can reach America Online users.

But partly because of its lack of compatibility and the FCC conditions,
America Online hasn't kept up with rivals in offering new services. MSN and
Yahoo have had video-conferencing via instant-messaging since last year. AOL
has denied that it has held back on video messaging to avoid making its
system interoperable, arguing there is little consumer demand for it.

But the new features have paid off for the company's rivals, and they are
catching up. Between last October and April, Microsoft's Messenger user base
rose 32% to 29.1 million, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Yahoo's
base jumped 19% to 19.2 million users. In the same period, the number of
users of AOL-branded messaging services increased 7% to 54.9 million.

This thread is starting to rapidly decay ...

these are old bits which I cannot explain exactly why I thought they
were important now or why I went rummaging through back folders to
find them or even why I felt compelled by a deep sense of inner
purpose to post them here ...

20 NEW SIGNS THAT YOU WERE ABDUCTED BY SPACE ALIENS!

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- You may have been abducted by space aliens --
and not even know it!

Psychiatrists, psychologists and UFO experts say millions of people
all over the world have been kidnapped by extraterrestrials. But most
of them can't recall the experience because the memory is so painful
that they've buried it deep in their subconscious minds.

But there are strong tip-offs that you may be one of the millions who
have encountered beings from another planet, if you know what to watch
for.

Experts at Wake Forest University here, as well as other respected
institutions around the world, offer 20 startling new indicators that
you may have had a close encounter:

1. You experience unexplained nausea or a strange sense of uneasiness
around the same time each day.

2. You have an unusual new scar or strange mark on your body --
particularly on the roof of your mouth or behind an ear.

3. You often find yourself hungry for oranges or lemons -- even after
you've had a large meal or eaten enough food to fill your
stomach. Researchers at Oslo University say this hunger for citrus is
common in alien abductees.

4. You have a strong, ever-present feeling that there is some mission
or important thing you're supposed to do in life and you find yourself
constantly driven to achieve it or discover what it might be.

5. You often find yourself going through your trash, or the trash of
others, without knowing exactly what you're looking for. Swiss UFO
researchers found that people who have been abducted often find
themselves unaccountably digging through refuse.

6. You frequently dream of cattle. Psychologists at the University of
Paris say it's common for the subconscious mind to substitute a cow or
bull for an alien being.

7. You feel you're ""special"" or ""chosen.""

8. You are a vegetarian -- but can't exactly explain why.

9. You have an overpowering feeling of dread when you see photos or
drawings of space aliens.

10. You are prone to addictive or compulsive behavior. This in itself
is not necessarily indicative of alien abduction. But if there are
other indicators as well, you could be an abductee.

11. You wet the bed. Studies in Peru show there's a connection.

12. You have frequent insomnia.

13. You are strangely intrigued by old western movies. Psychologists
say they can't yet explain abductees' fascination with cowboy movies,
but they say it exists in at least 75 percent of victims.

14. Electronic devices often go haywire around you for no discernible
reason.

15. You have seen -- or think you've seen -- a mysterious, hooded
figure in or near your home more than once.

16. Your fingers are stiff, numb or unresponsive for more than an hour
after you wake up.

17. You have had -- or currently have -- severe back or neck problems.

18. You frequently experience a ringing in one ear.

19. You often get sinusitis or other nasal pain.

20. You are frequently haunted by the sense that you're being watched.

That's clearly the same bug.

I don't think I can fix it either...I certainly can't while my copy of Brent's 
book is across town.  I do understand parts of tk fairly well, but the 
event handlers give me a headache.

Yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible
ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  I've ended
up taking a very different route: TMDA (http://www.tmda.net).  In
particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to
the messages I send to specific lists.

For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of
claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is:

 to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda

which rewrites my From: header transparently.  When I get next month's
batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about
resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a
TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question
is able to send mail to).

				  -+-

Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.  

Reasons:

  nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on
  a defined host.  The port number cannot be configured (it calls
  getservbyname() which does a lookup against ""smtp"" in /etc/services).
  Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead
  of SMTP.

  Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not
  recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail
  delivery failure modes.  Further, when nmh is configured to use
  sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:

    .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv

  which creates problems:

    Postfix does not support ""-bv"" and returns in error

    Exim does not support ""-t"" with ""-bv"" and returns in error

    Don't mention Qmail.  I won't use it.

  ""whom"" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose.  

    It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout
    about this.  The ""-bv"" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to
    being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs.
    Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a
    non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP.  nmh's
    current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in
    /etc/services) is a pain.

I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's
""whom"" support using Exim's system filter:

  0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:

    DATADIR
    ALLOW_MODE_640
    CRYPT_KEY_FILE
    FINGERPRINT

  1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group ""mail"".

  2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO.

  3) Set the following options in exim.conf:

    message_filter = ""/etc/exim/filter""
    message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe

  4) /etc/exim/filter reads:

    # Exim filter
    testprint ""local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}""
    testprint ""domain: ${domain: $h_From:}""
    if ""$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:"" is """" and 
       ""${domain: $h_From:}"" is ""kanga.nu"" and
       ""${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}"" is ""true""
    then
      pipe ""/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config""
      finish
    endif

  Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that
  they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  Hack appropriately for
  your setup.

Basic explanation:

  Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is
  configured) before attempting delivery.  The above system filter
  extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru
  that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject.

  The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement
  for the chgrp mail.  If your Exim installation runs as a different
  user, chgrp as appropriate.

  It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I
  haven't investigated that end.

Notes:

  This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA
  has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),
  and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  If
  you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for
  other domains and $HOME paths.  I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so
  don't care.  You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if
  you wish.

  A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail
  servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA
  support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less
  complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA
  configuration.

Caveat Emptor.  

  ObNote: I've also written a small patch against TMDA 0.58 to add a
  ""hold"" delivery method (identical to ""confirm"" except it sends no
  confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing
  silent sidetracking of mail).

Antimissile defense is designed to operate in ~LEO environment, and knocks
out stuff by kinetic kill or nearby nuking (damage by neutron flux
impacting the fissibles). It is *not* designed to apply a 100 MT warhead

modeled.

The anti-missile defense is about worse than useless in this case. The
only way to protect is determining orbits at high precision and deflecting
long-term. Decades for targets this size.

I'm running with autosort right now.  If I don't see any problems, I' run with 
autopack for a while.

I did find some stuff that was being called too many times when auto-sort was
enabled, but otherwise it seems to be working.

My computer is a lot faster than the last time I tried autosort (back in the 
mid-90s); this is actually acceptable.

Once I've confirmed that nothing actually breaks, I think I'll look into a few 
more places that autosort needs to be called, because right now it only sorts 
when you change to a folder, but if a new message arrives in the folder you're 
looking at, it doesn't get sorted.

This topic comes up every so often on this list.  The short answer is 
no, there really isn't an IMAP server which knows how to do this.

The longer answer is, UW-IMAP claims it does, but doesn't do a good 
job, and doesn't update scan caches, unseen, etc.

You may have better luck while on the road using raw mh commands to 
read you e-mail if you have ssh access to your internal environment.
I've been doing this for quite a long time, and, after the learning 
curve of the mh command set (which I still don't know completely),
I'm quite able to access my e-mail and respond to those e-mails which 
require a response.

Another option is using mutt as your mail client when you're remotely 
accessing e-mail.  Mutt does a decent job of dealing with mh folders, 
though it doesn't update scan caches or unseen files either.  But it 
is a decent interface alternative to raw mh, and it's quite 
customizable.

The real answer to your question is that we need not an IMAP server 
that understands mh folders, but an mh server to which a local client 
could connect to.  In theory, it shouldn't be too hard (technically) 
to cobble this together with ssh.  Replace all of exmh's calls to mh 
commands with a wrapper which uses ssh to lob these commands over to 
a remote system, and dump the output back into the local exmh client.

It does.  If anybody in the nmh world actually gets to the point of actually 
implementing imap access, this will need to change, but until there exists an 
environment where the direct access doesn't work, we're not going to take the 
performance hit.

July 28, 2002
Venture Capitalists Are Taking the Gloves Off
By LYNNLEY BROWNING

The venture capital world is looking less like a genteel club and more like
a brawling barroom.

Venture capitalists are offering the companies they bankroll increasingly
hard-knuckled deals that leave little wealth for a start-up's managers or
original backers. The moves are leading some entrepreneurs, desperate for
money, to decry today's investors as bullies. Some venture capitalists are
even suing rival venture firms, asserting that the tough new terms are
wiping out the value of their previous investments.

""People are playing hardball,"" said Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at
Charles River Ventures, based in Waltham, Mass.

The bursting of the Internet stock bubble more than two years ago wiped out
many venture investments in dot-coms. Now, amid the bear market in stocks
and limited prospects for investors or young companies to make money soon,
venture capitalists are looking for novel ways to make money. As a result,
""private companies are facing the most onerous terms from venture
capitalists that we have seen in 20 years,"" said Steven E. Bochner, a
securities lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif.,
who represents venture firms.

In the boom of the late 1990's, venture capitalists chose one of two
options. They could be paid back their invested capital, share in profits
and receive dividends. Or they could convert their preferred shares into
common stock when the private company held an initial public offering or
was sold. During that time of huge payouts for newly public and acquired
companies, they usually chose No. 2.

But with markets now all but dead for initial public offerings and mergers
and acquisitions, venture capitalists from Silicon Valley to the East Coast
are increasingly demanding - and getting - both options. This ""double dip,""
known as ""participating preferred,"" leaves far less potential wealth for a
company's founders and previous investors. Venture capitalists are also
negotiating more deals with heightened ""liquidation preferences,"" in which
start-ups agree to pay back the initial investment at least two or three
times over.

Previously, venture capitalists handed over money to a start-up in a lump
sum. But more are now parceling out funds in tranches, and then only when
the new companies reach certain milestones - a sales target, for example,
or the hiring of a particular chief executive.

They are even trying to protect their investments through veto rights that
permit them to block future investments from other venture capitalists who
might dilute their stakes, said Mark G. Borden, chairman of the corporate
department at Hale & Dorr, a law firm based in Boston. As a result, Mr.
Borden said, a start-up company that casts its lot with a particular
venture capitalist or group of investors may find itself tethered to those
backers and unable to raise new money elsewhere.

ENTREPRENEURS particularly dislike one recent trend: venture capitalists
have been pushing young companies to agree, retroactively, to lower the
prices that investors now pay for shares should the start-up be worth less
when it tries to raise more money later. Such a move, known as a ""full
ratchet,"" is intended to prevent an investor's stake from being diluted.
But it can significantly reduce or even wipe out the stakes of a company's
original investors and managers, giving the new investors most of the
company for a song.

""If you were in the first round of investors, you generally now get
crushed"" when a start-up raises more money later, said J. Edmund Colloton,
general partner and chief operating officer of Bessemer Venture Partners,
based in Wellesley Hills, Mass.

Consider Mahi Networks, a private optical networking start-up. In three
rounds of financing, from September 1999 to November 2001, Mahi raised $110
million from blue-chip venture firms like Benchmark Capital, Sequoia
Capital, the GE Capital unit of General Electric and the venture arm of
Goldman Sachs. At one point during the Internet boom, Mahi was valued at
more than $180 million.

Last month, though, a new group of smaller-name investors, led by St. Paul
Venture Capital of Minneapolis, acquired about three-quarters of the
company for $75 million in financing. Before that, Mahi was valued at only
$25 million, said Chris Rust, Mahi's president and chief executive. But
most of that was tied up in employee incentives, including stock options,
leaving almost no value for existing investors.

Despite having nurtured Mahi with money and advice, the early investors
chose not to back the company further. With the new, lower valuation,
""there was effectively no value attributed to all of our previous
investments,"" said one venture capitalist whose firm was an early backer.
""We were all completely washed out"" in the last round, said the investor,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.

There is no hard data on the prevalence of the newer, tougher terms.
Venture capitalists are famously secretive about their deals, which are
private and largely unregulated. But ask venture capitalists or securities
lawyers who work with start-ups, and tales of onerous terms will abound.
""At the end of the day, the money is coming with strings attached,"" said
Mark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, a
trade group based in Arlington, Va.

The shift has turned the conventional wisdom on its head. Venture
capitalists once loved risk, but no more. The Internet bust and Wall
Street's slump have left them scrambling to make money to repay their own
investors and to justify their management fees.

Venture capitalists once clamored to be first in the door of a hot new
company. Now they can usually make money only by being the most recent
investor. ""We're certainly looking for later-stage deals, where you get the
benefit of the previous investors having taken the risk,"" said Todd Dagres,
a general partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass.

Some entrepreneurs agree to the harsh new terms simply because they have no
other way to raise cash to survive. But other managers now shun the
investors, whom they call ""vulture capitalists,"" bent on picking the meat
off a young or struggling start-up. Today's venture capitalists ""want to
take advantage of you,"" said George R. Waller, chief executive of Strike
Force Technologies, an employee-financed software maker in West Orange,
N.J. Mr. Waller said he had turned away 30 venture firms in recent months
because they had demanded, among other things, hard-to-reach sales
milestones.

George J. Nassef, chief executive of ValetNoir, a start-up based in New
York that makes marketing software for casinos, said several venture firms
had even asked in recent months to have their potential investments secured
with receivables, or money owed to ValetNoir by its customers. He turned
them all down.

NOT surprisingly, the shift in financing terms is upsetting some venture
firms that were early investors in start-ups but are now suffering as the
companies seek to raise additional money at bargain-basement prices.

In one high-profile case, Benchmark Capital, a blue-chip Silicon Valley
firm, sued the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Juniper Financial
this month. Benchmark was an early investor in Juniper, an online financial
services concern, having put $20 million into it in early 2000, just before
the Internet bubble burst. It also contributed to a second, $94 million
round that September. Juniper, based in Wilmington, Del., is seeking to
raise $50 million from Canadian Imperial, which already owns around half
the company, but on terms that would sharply dilute Benchmark's original,
unspecified stake. Benchmark sued to prevent the start-up from raising the
money. All the parties declined to comment on the case, which a Delaware
judge threw out last week.

Such friction was rare during the boom, when venture capitalists operated
like a competitive but tight-knit fraternity, channeling deals to one
another. Start-ups and their backers saw their interests as allied. But in
tighter markets, ""there's a lot of ugly behavior coming out,"" said Mr.
Bochner, the Wilson Sonsini lawyer. ""There's going to be much more
litigation like this.""

[NYT] A Sudden Rush to Declare Bankruptcy is Expected,adam@xent.com,FoRK@xent.com,"Sun, 28 Jul 2002 22:06:11 -0700","Welcome to 2002.  Companies that have taken on way too much debt can
screw their shareholders and even some of their debt-holders by
declaring bankruptcy, as Enron and Worldcom have done; meanwhile,
it becomes more difficult for individuals who have similarly taken on
too much debt, to dig their way out of their own holes...

In my next life, I'm coming back as a corporation.  They get all the
perks. :)

A Sudden Rush to Declare Bankruptcy Is Expected
By PHILIP SHENON

WASHINGTON, July 26 The compromise bill, which was approved on Thursday
by Congressional negotiators and is expected to be adopted in both the
House and Senate by the end of next week, will make it much harder for
Americans to wipe out their debts when they declare bankruptcy.

After the agreement, lawyers around the country said that they had begun
to receive calls and visits from debtors worried that they needed to
file bankruptcy before the old rules lapse next year.

""I've had plenty of calls this morning,"" said Gary F. Weltmann, a
consumer bankruptcy lawyer in Washington. ""And I'm telling people that
they need to take action now.""

Marty K. Courson, a bankruptcy lawyer in San Francisco, said he was
""getting ready for the onslaught.""

""I do think there will be a lot of people trying to use the old rules,""
he said.

The White House announced today that President Bush would sign the bill,
which was scheduled for a final vote in the House late tonight and in
the Senate next week. 

""The president looks forward to signing that,"" said Ari Fleischer, the
White House spokesman. ""That bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support
for good reasons."" 

The bill, which had been stalled until this week in a House-Senate
conference committee, passed both chambers by overwhelming margins more
than a year ago. The conference committee approved the bill Thursday
after agreeing on an abortion-rights provision that had been the final
obstacle to passage; the provision will bar anti-abortion protesters
from using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying court judgments as a
result of clinic protests.

The bill has long been the top legislative priority of the credit card
and banking industries, which say that many people now abuse the
bankruptcy system by writing off debts that they should be able to
pay. There were 1.45 million bankruptcy filings last year, a record, up
19 percent from 2000.

""This legislation restores integrity and accountability to our
bankruptcy system by offering a fresh start to those who deserve one
while cracking down on those who don't,"" said Representative F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee.

Critics, including top consumer-rights groups, described the bill as a
gift to lenders in exchange for a recent, drastic increase in campaign
contributions to members of Congress. They also said that it would do
harm to millions of Americans in financial distress as a result of lost
jobs, poor health or divorce.

The bill's opponents have also questioned the timing of its passage,
which comes in the midst of a Congressional crackdown on abusive
accounting practices by many of the largest companies, including some of
the same financial services companies that have lobbied strenuously for
the bankruptcy bill.

""The timing couldn't be worse,"" said Travis B. Plunkett, the legislative
director of the Consumer Federation of America. ""It takes a lot of gall
for Congress to make a move like this when so many Americans are
concerned about corporate abuses, and when the economy is so shaky."" 

Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who is a leading critic of
the bill, said today that ""it boggles the mind that at a time when
Americans are more economically vulnerable, when they are most in need
of protection from financial disaster, we would eviscerate the major
financial safety net in our society for the middle class.""

Bankruptcy lawyers said that the bill would do harm to low- and
middle-income clients who would be saddled with debts that would take
them years to pay back. The new law will end the debt-free ""fresh start""
that many of those debtors had been permitted under the current law.

Recent studies have shown that the average American filing for
bankruptcy has a median household income well below the national average
of about $42,000 in 2000. A study cited in Congressional testimony last
year showed that the average person filing for bankruptcy had a car that
was six to nine years old, and that a quarter of those people had
medical debts exceeding $1,000.

""I won't deny that there are people who abuse the bankruptcy system,""
said Mr. Weltmann, the Washington lawyer whose firm calls itself the
Bankruptcy Center. ""But there are honest, hard-working folks who are
really going to be affected by these changes.""

The bill would impose a means test on debtors, based on median incomes
in their home states, for bankruptcy filings under Charter 7 of the
federal bankruptcy law, which permits debtors to erase most of their
unsecured debts, like credit card bills.

Debtors with an income above the state median would be barred from
filing under Chapter 7 and would instead be required to file instead
under Chapter 13, which requires that a portion of the unsecured debt be
repaid over time under the court-administered plan.

Mr. Courson, the San Francisco lawyer, said that the changes would ""hurt
a lot of consumer debtors who really, rightfully belong in Chapter 7.""

""My clients, for the most part, are honest and unfortunate people, and
they've just got heavy debt,"" he said. ""You can always find some
circumstance where a person really went to town with a credit card and
got themselves in trouble. But I have people who are just plain old
poor. My experience is something wildly different than the story that
the credit card companies make to Congress.""

At its peak, there were more than 100 peer-to-peer start-ups. There now
remain, at most, a couple of dozen companies concentrated in a few
niches. The main activity of companies venturing into peer to peer is
file sharing. But the dozens of overoptimistic forays into alternative
economic systems, hyper-sophisticated technologies, and recording
industry collaboration turned out to be dead ends.  Peer-to-peer
auctions, peer-to-peer supply chain management, and peer-to-peer e-mail
may have failed because they were ahead of their time. It's more likely
they failed because they were just ahead of themselves.  Clearly, the
public's appetite for file sharing has increased, and the state of the
art has improved dramatically. But companies have still not yet found
satisfactory business models, thus leaving file sharing's last chapter
unwritten.

XML proxies are add-ons to firewall and network environments that have
the ability to monitor XML traffic and apply business rules and IT
policies such as security, routing, performance, management,
transformation, and connection provisioning.  Current firewalls aren't
able to peek in the envelope and decipher XML traffic, said report
author Ronald Schmelzer, ZapThink senior analyst.  XML proxies are not
only able to understand network protocols, but also the XML-based
content traveling on top of those protocols, Schmelzer said.  ZapThink
identifies a slew of new vendors with XML-ready security solutions,
including Flamenco Networks, Forum Systems, Reactivity, Vordel, and
Westbridge Technology, among others... ZapThink estimates that XML
represents just 2 percent of network traffic today, but that will
increase to almost 25 percent by 2006.

Let me answer my own question.
This seems to be a problem in tk8.4.
There is a switch statement at lines 691-697 in ispell.tcl inside a catch.
It ends with a line ending with a backslash, followed by a blank line.

This seems to be enough to confuse this verson of tk.  Removing the backslash
causes the error to go away, and the catch is not executed.

Bits for posterity: Astronomical sleuthing,Rodent of Unusual Size <Ken.Coar@Golux.Com>,Flatware or Road Kill? <FoRK@xent.com>,"Wed, 31 Jul 2002 10:28:24 -0400","From: Donald Eastlake 3rd <dee3@torque.pothole.com>

<http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/16/science/space/16MOON.html>

July 16, 2002
By Yonder Blessed Moon, Sleuths Decode Life and Art
By LEON JAROFF

On its way back from the Pacific island of Tinian, where it had
delivered the uranium core for the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima,
the heavy cruiser Indianapolis was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine
I-58 and sent to the bottom of the Philippine Sea. It was one of the
worst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200
crew members survived.

Now experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic
story a startling new twist.

It was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they
write in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made
the sinking possible.

Using astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as
well as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the
submarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58
surfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And,
they said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds.

Looking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship
silhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six
torpedoes sent it to the bottom.

""It was sheer chance,"" said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. ""Without
that alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the
cruiser, especially at that distance.""

With Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a
university honors course called ""Astronomy in Art, History and
Literature."" In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place
of the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of
astronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the
moon in military and other encounters.

Two years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright
star in van Gogh's ""White House at Night."" He and some students went to
Auvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched
until they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters
from van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was
completed in June 1890.

Noting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where
van Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed,
and from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had
been illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then
identified the ""star."" It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June
had occupied that part of the sky.

A final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van
Gogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the
middle of the month that year.

Dr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the
opening of ""Hamlet,"" when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the
""star that's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that
part of heaven where now it burns."" From the guards' description, the
season and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright
stars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson's calculations placed it in the
constellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars.

Pondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly
inspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho's star,
for the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia,
creating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would
certainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed
by the description of the supernova in a history book that was the
source of some of his best-known plays.

Dr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that
night was Tycho's, and he has an impressive record of other
astronomy-based sleuthing.

Aware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his
negatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic
""Moon and Half Dome."" At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found
Adams's vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the
moon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak
and other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at
4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960.

Then, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical
at 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams's daughter-in-law
visited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of ""Moon and the
Half Dome"" in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual
moon and the Half Dome.

Analyzing Chaucer's works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly
rapid movement of the moon described in ""The Merchant's Tale"" occurred
in April 1389. And in ""The Franklin's Tale,"" Chaucer's description of
the heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the
Brittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur
astronomer.

Then there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride,
how did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit
night in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson's computer program revealed that,
while the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the
southern horizon and did not illuminate Revere's boat.

Dr. Olson's proudest achievement was explaining ""the tide that failed""
in the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943.
Planners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over
a reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with
drafts of at least four feet, to pass.

But that day and the next, in the words of some observers, ""the ocean
just sat there,"" providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a
mean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge
of the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600
yards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun
fire from the Japanese.

Asked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six
months researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the
military planners were aware that they had to contend with a ""neap""
tide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its
first or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes
water levels to deviate less.

But that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth
and exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed
and the marines in trouble.

""I'm not in the least blaming the planners,"" Dr. Olson said, explaining
that the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn't been
applied to the waters at Tarawa.

Indeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, ""We can
calculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history.""

Yet Dr. Olson's greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his
interdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. ""I have thought
about van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,"" he says, ""and that has
made my life as a scientist much richer.""

My copy of the tree right now is full of organizational changes in

* TabletPC form factors, while not perfect, are quite usable (light,
relatively thin, some can convert from laptop to tablet use by flipping the
screen).
* Pushbutton switching between portrait and landscape screen orientation.
* TabletPCs I saw came with built-in WiFi.
* Good to very good integration of handwriting into existing applications,
and there is a very nice new note-taking application specifically for
handwritten notes.
* Good set of APIs for adding handwriting into existing applications (at the
most simple, it's only a few additional lines of code)
* Prices of the hardware will be around mid-range laptop (will vary by
model)

I believe the TabletPC will be very successful, and is a much bigger deal
than the relative lack of press coverage would suggest. I'm definitely
starting to think about how I could incorporate one into my routine...

Years ago, there was a package called mh-e which was an emacs interface
to MH.  I don't know if it's still around or works.  But it's an idea.

inbox mail notification broken,Marc Baaden <baaden@smplinux.de>,exmh-users@spamassassin.taint.org,"Tue, 06 Aug 2002 09:04:58 +0100","
Hi,

I am experiencing a strange problem since a couple of days now,
I have several folders with unseen sequences, and when there is
new mail they are highlighted. This works fine.

But .. since a couple of days the actual inbox won't be highlighted
any more when there is new mail. On the other hand the unseen window
still indicates if there is new mail in the inbox.

All other folders seem to work properly.

Any hints ?

Workshop on Web Site Evolution (WSE 2002), being held October 2, 2002, in
Montreal, Canada.

http://star.itc.it/wse2002/

- Jim

>>From the Web page:

 The potential of the Web as a vehicle for offering a variety of services is
becoming more apparent as Web sites evolve their contents from static
information to more dynamic and interactive forms. A number of new standards
and commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing
Web-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the
range and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.

The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web
design, software engineering, and information technology communities to
discuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and
tool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.
Expertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and
experience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing
platforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and
Internet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation
of form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the
Web.

WSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related
to exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not
limited to):

*   Migrating to Web services
*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product
control
*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable
*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure
*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple
platforms
*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as
architecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites
*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolution

WSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software
Maintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event
focused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of
""maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems"" nicely compliments WSE
2002's overall theme and goals.

Probably a private sequence has gotten set, the highlighting only

If ""scan unseen"" works as you'd expect, but highlighting doesn't,

Despite being the author of SpamAssassin, I've never fixed exmh to do
this.  I am therefore clearly not an exmh hacker ;)

But to simplify -- the first action is piping the message to an external
command, then replacing the message file with the output; and the second
is simply piping the message to another command, then ignoring the output.
I'd say it's easy enough to do, if someone can provide the tcl.

(BTW, RAID is the home-grown bug tracking system used at Microsoft.
See e.g. http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/CrossTalk/1995/oct/Shippin.asp.
It was a fine tool, better than any other I've had to use...)



The Bug Count Also Rises


by John Browne
(Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner)

In the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves 
of the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles 
drove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then 
later brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air.

Many days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles 
and drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong.

Hernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came 
to him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were 
not yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in 
Cafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you 
thought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the 
floor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they 
ate at you.

When Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. ""The RAID is huge 
with bugs,"" Hernando said. ""The bugs are infinite.""

""Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs.""

""Once you were great with the bugs,"" Hernando said. ""No one was 
greater,"" he said again. ""Even Prado.""

""Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs.""

Hernando shrugged. ""Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in 
Chicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers.""

""Herb tea?""

""It is true, my friend."" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his 
office and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels.

Michaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for 
awhile, then he asked Michaels, ""I need you to triage for me.""

Michaels looked down. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said.

""This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs.""

""I'm finished with that,"" Michaels said again. ""I just want to live 
quietly.""

""Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only 
drink herb tea.""

""Herb tea?"" Michaels said.

""It is true,"" he said sorrowfully.

Michaels stood up. ""Then I will do it, my friend,"" he said formally. ""I 
will do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for 
the time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time 
Prado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them 
with no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all 
the pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank.""

Together they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they 
walked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried 
the bodies back from the meetings.

If memory serves, RAID was in use when I joined Microsoft

It may be a conspiracy against spell checkers. I noticed the Spell icon

2.4?

2.5 has been out for over a year.

I can't think of anything with those symptoms in 2.4, but why don't you try 
the upgrade and see if you still have the problem.

  FBI warns about wireless craze


  Some FBI agents are worried about warchalking

  Well-meaning wireless activists have caught the attention of the US Federal Bureau
  of Investigation. 
  One of its agents has issued a warning about the popular practice of using chalk marks
  to show the location of wireless networks. 

  The marks, or ""warchalks"", are cropping up in cities and suburbs across the world. 

  The FBI is now telling companies that, if they see the chalk marks outside their
  offices, they should check the security of wireless networks and ensure they remain
  closed to outsiders. 

  Top marks 

  The warchalking phenomena is only a couple of months old but it has generated a huge
  amount of interest. 

  The idea behind warchalking is to use a standardised set of symbols to mark the
  existence of wireless networks that anyone can use to go online. 

  Many community groups and local governments, and even some public-spirited
  companies, are setting up wireless nodes that give people fast net access. 


  This symbol denotes a closed wireless node 

  The wireless networks replace computer cables with radio and are usually very easy to
  set up and connect to. 

  Before now many curious hackers have gone on ""wardriving"" expeditions which
  involve them driving around an area logging the location of the wireless networks. 

  Many companies using wireless do not do enough to make them secure and stop people
  outside the organisation using them. 

  So the FBI is issuing advice to companies to be on the lookout for warchalk marks as a
  pointer to the security of their wireless network. 

  ""If you notice these symbols at your place of business, it is likely your network has
  been identified publicly,"" warns the guidance from the FBI. 

  Scare stories? 

  The agent who circulated the warning in Pittsburgh said it was not an official FBI
  advisory or policy but was information worth passing on. 

  He urged anyone using a wireless network to ensure that it was secure and used only by
  those a company wants to access it. 

  Warchalkers have questioned the scare stories surrounding the phenomena, saying that
  anyone with malicious intent is unlikely to publicly mark their target. 

  The phrases ""wardriving"" and ""warchalking"" derive from the early days of computer
  hacking when curious users programmed their computers to search for all phone lines
  that returned data tones. The exhaustive searching was known as ""wardialling"".

I'll take the blame.

The reason, I suspect, is that we're needlessly reading the .sequences file 
multiple times because of other sequences.  I need to make the code much 
smarter about handling that file, but first I have a few other fish to fry in 
my rather large patch that's on it's way.

New Sequences Window,Chris Garrigues <cwg-exmh@DeepEddy.Com>,exmh-workers@spamassassin.taint.org,"Tue, 20 Aug 2002 17:27:47 -0500","I've just checked in a rather large patch which replaces the Unseen Window 
with a new Sequences Window.

Since the preference items are different, you'll need to turn the display of 
the sequences window on in the preferences even if you had the unseen window 
enabled.  I couldn't figure out how to default the preferences to match the 
unseen window.

I'm hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are purely 
cosmetic changes.

For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to display 
the other sequences.  Preferences allow you to say if you want a given 
sequence display to never show or to always show.

I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
week or so ago.

The two things that I know I need to do are to fix the performance issue that 
I think is what Anders was seeing yesterday and to catch the documentation up 
with the code.

My wife is out for an ""evening with the girls"" tonight, so I should be able to 
work on the performance issue tonight and check it in after some testing in a 
day or two.

I hope I didn't break very much with all the changes I made...

Was it intended that if you added a sequence to the 'never show' list that
it not take effect till you stopped and restarted exmh?  I added 'pseq',

Hmm - I've been using MH for a long time (since well before there were
sequences) and I don't think I've ever seen a ""pseq"" ...

I'm guessing that that's the sequence that you have ""pick"" create
As I recall it, it has no default sequence name, so the sequence names
that people use will tend to vary from person to person won't they
(except as MH configurations move around institutions by osmosis).

I've always used ""sel"" for that purpose.

I kind of doubt that any pre built-in sequence name is going to be
very general.   Even ""unseen"" can be changed (fortunately that one
is easy to find in the MH profile - though whether exmh does that,
os just uses ""unseen"" I haven't bothered to find out).

The other is more unique, taking imprints of circuit boards, cellular

Just ignore the laws completely. You cannot win the legal way, because the

We need an uncensorable, hardened P2P infrastructure to distribute such

Axelrod, eh? ""the E.coli of social psychology""? Nice to see our old friend still going strong -- Prisoner's Dilemma is old enough to qualify for AARP membership!

Regarding experimental design, it is interesting that 1) they used an all-female panel and 2) they included a mix of ages, from 20-60 and 3) they used humans, confederates, computers as well as imitations.

Why We're So Nice: We're Wired to Cooperate

July 23, 2002
By NATALIE ANGIER 




 

What feels as good as chocolate on the tongue or money in
the bank but won't make you fat or risk a subpoena from the
Securities and Exchange Commission? 

Hard as it may be to believe in these days of infectious
greed and sabers unsheathed, scientists have discovered
that the small, brave act of cooperating with another
person, of choosing trust over cynicism, generosity over
selfishness, makes the brain light up with quiet joy. 

Studying neural activity in young women who were playing a
classic laboratory game called the Prisoner's Dilemma, in
which participants can select from a number of greedy or
cooperative strategies as they pursue financial gain,
researchers found that when the women chose mutualism over
""me-ism,"" the mental circuitry normally associated with
reward-seeking behavior swelled to life. 

And the longer the women engaged in a cooperative strategy,
the more strongly flowed the blood to the pathways of
pleasure. 

The researchers, performing their work at Emory University
in Atlanta, used magnetic resonance imaging to take what
might be called portraits of the brain on hugs. 

""The results were really surprising to us,"" said Dr.
Gregory S. Berns, a psychiatrist and an author on the new
report, which appears in the current issue of the journal
Neuron. ""We went in expecting the opposite."" 

The researchers had thought that the biggest response would
occur in cases where one person cooperated and the other
defected, when the cooperator might feel that she was being
treated unjustly. 

Instead, the brightest signals arose in cooperative
alliances and in those neighborhoods of the brain already
known to respond to desserts, pictures of pretty faces,
money, cocaine and any number of licit or illicit delights.


""It's reassuring,"" Dr. Berns said. ""In some ways, it says
that we're wired to cooperate with each other."" 

The study is among the first to use M.R.I. technology to
examine social interactions in real time, as opposed to
taking brain images while subjects stared at static
pictures or thought-prescribed thoughts. 

It is also a novel approach to exploring an ancient
conundrum, why are humans so, well, nice? Why are they
willing to cooperate with people whom they barely know and
to do good deeds and to play fair a surprisingly high
percentage of the time? 

Scientists have no trouble explaining the evolution of
competitive behavior. But the depth and breadth of human
altruism, the willingness to forgo immediate personal gain
for the long-term common good, far exceeds behaviors seen
even in other large-brained highly social species like
chimpanzees and dolphins, and it has as such been difficult
to understand. 

""I've pointed out to my students how impressive it is that
you can take a group of young men and women of prime
reproductive age, have them come into a classroom, sit down
and be perfectly comfortable and civil to each other,"" said
Dr. Peter J. Richerson, a professor of environmental
science and policy at the University of California at Davis
and an influential theorist in the field of cultural
evolution. ""If you put 50 male and 50 female chimpanzees
that don't know each other into a lecture hall, it would be
a social explosion."" 

Dr. Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich and colleagues
recently presented findings on the importance of punishment
in maintaining cooperative behavior among humans and the
willingness of people to punish those who commit crimes or
violate norms, even when the chastisers take risks and gain
nothing themselves while serving as ad hoc police. 

In her survey of the management of so-called commons in
small-scale communities where villagers have the right, for
example, to graze livestock on commonly held land, Dr.
Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University found that all
communities have some form of monitoring to gird against
cheating or using more than a fair share of the resource. 

In laboratory games that mimic small-scale commons, Dr.
Richerson said, 20 to 30 percent have to be coerced by a
threat of punishment to cooperate. 

Fear alone is not highly likely to inspire cooperative
behavior to the degree observed among humans. If research
like Dr. Fehr's shows the stick side of the equation, the
newest findings present the neural carrot - people
cooperate because it feels good to do it. 

In the new findings, the researchers studied 36 women from
20 to 60 years old, many of them students at Emory and
inspired to participate by the promise of monetary rewards.
The scientists chose an all-female sample because so few
brain-imaging studies have looked at only women. Most have
been limited to men or to a mixture of men and women. 

But there is a vast body of non- imaging data that rely on
using the Prisoner's Dilemma. 

""It's a simple and elegant model for reciprocity,"" said Dr.
James K. Rilling, an author on the Neuron paper who is at
Princeton. ""It's been referred to as the E. coli of social
psychology."" 

>>From past results, the researchers said, one can assume
that neuro- imaging studies of men playing the game would
be similar to their new findings with women. 

The basic structure of the trial had two women meet each
other briefly ahead of time. One was placed in the scanner
while the other remained outside the scanning room. The two
interacted by computer, playing about 20 rounds of the
game. In every round, each player pressed a button to
indicate whether she would ""cooperate"" or ""defect."" Her
answer would be shown on-screen to the other player. 

The monetary awards were apportioned after each round. If
one player defected and the other cooperated, the defector
earned $3 and the cooperator nothing. If both chose to
cooperate, each earned $2. If both opted to defect, each
earned $1. 

Hence, mutual cooperation from start to finish was a far
more profitable strategy, at $40 a woman, than complete
mutual defection, which gave each $20. 

The risk that a woman took each time she became greedy for
a little bit more was that the cooperative strategy would
fall apart and that both would emerge the poorer. 

In some cases, both women were allowed to pursue any
strategy that they chose. In other cases, the non- scanned
woman would be a ""confederate"" with the researchers,
instructed, unbeknown to the scanned subject, to defect
after three consecutive rounds of cooperation, the better
to keep things less rarefied and pretty and more lifelike
and gritty. 

In still other experiments, the woman in the scanner played
a computer and knew that her partner was a machine. In
other tests, women played a computer but thought that it
was a human. 

The researchers found that as a rule the freely
strategizing women cooperated. Even occasional episodes of
defection, whether from free strategizers or confederates,
were not necessarily fatal to an alliance. 

""The social bond could be reattained easily if the defector
chose to cooperate in the next couple of rounds,"" another
author of the report, Dr. Clinton D. Kilts, said, ""although
the one who had originally been `betrayed' might be wary
from then on."" 

As a result of the episodic defections, the average
per-experiment take for the participants was in the $30's.
""Some pairs, though, got locked into mutual defection,"" Dr.
Rilling said. 

Analyzing the scans, the researchers found that in rounds
of cooperation, two broad areas of the brain were
activated, both rich in neurons able to respond to
dopamine, the brain chemical famed for its role in
addictive behaviors. 

One is the anteroventral striatum in the middle of the
brain right above the spinal cord. Experiments with rats
have shown that when electrodes are placed in the striatum,
the animals will repeatedly press a bar to stimulate the
electrodes, apparently receiving such pleasurable feedback
that they will starve to death rather than stop pressing
the bar. 

Another region activated during cooperation was the
orbitofrontal cortex in the region right above the eyes. In
addition to being part of the reward-processing system, Dr.
Rilling said, it is also involved in impulse control. 

""Every round, you're confronted with the possibility of
getting an extra dollar by defecting,"" he said. ""The choice
to cooperate requires impulse control."" 

Significantly, the reward circuitry of the women was
considerably less responsive when they knew that they were
playing against a computer. The thought of a human bond,
but not mere monetary gain, was the source of contentment
on display. 

In concert with the imaging results, the women, when asked
afterward for summaries of how they felt during the games,
often described feeling good when they cooperated and
expressed positive feelings of camaraderie toward their
playing partners. 

Assuming that the urge to cooperate is to some extent
innate among humans and reinforced by the brain's feel-good
circuitry, the question of why it arose remains unclear.
Anthropologists have speculated that it took teamwork for
humanity's ancestors to hunt large game or gather difficult
plant foods or rear difficult children. So the capacity to
cooperate conferred a survival advantage on our forebears. 

Yet as with any other trait, the willingness to abide by
the golden rule and to be a good citizen and not cheat and
steal from one's neighbors is not uniformly distributed. 

""If we put some C.E.O.'s in here, I'd like to see how they
respond,"" Dr. Kilts said. ""Maybe they wouldn't find a
positive social interaction rewarding at all."" 

A Prisoner's Dilemma indeed.

I'm sure that at the end of the universe, they'll still only find Douglas Adams, calmly munching away on his mooburger :-)

The prospect of expansion so rapid that the night sky empties out because other galaxies are simply *outside* our light cone -- ??!? -- is really chilling. 

Puts comm latency in a whole new perspective... what if, in the future, processors go so fast there *is* no network? Or, at least, TCP segments would arrive so rarely they would seem as inscrutable as commandments from the heavens...

In the Beginning ...

July 23, 2002
By DENNIS OVERBYE 




 

It has always been easy to make fun of cosmologists,
confined to a dust mote lost in space, pronouncing judgment
on the fate of the universe or the behavior of galaxies
billions of light-years away, with only a few scraps of
light as evidence. 

""Cosmologists are often wrong,"" the Russian physicist Lev
Landau put it, ""but never in doubt."" 

For most of the 20th century, cosmology seemed less a
science than a religious war over, say, whether the
universe had a beginning, in a fiery Big Bang billions of
years ago, or whether it exists eternally in the so-called
Steady State. 



In the last few years, however, a funny thing has happened.
Cosmologists are beginning to agree with one another.
Blessed with new instruments like the Hubble Space
Telescope and other space-based observatories, a new
generation of their giant cousins on the ground and
ever-faster computer networks, cosmology is entering ""a
golden age"" in which data are finally outrunning
speculation. 

""The rate at which we are learning and discovering new
things is just extraordinary,"" said Dr. Charles Bennett, an
astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md. 

As a result, cosmologists are beginning to converge on what
they call a ""standard model"" of the universe that is
towering in its ambition. It purports to trace, at least in
broad strokes, cosmic history from the millisecond after
time began, when the universe was a boiling stew of energy
and subatomic particles, through the formation of atoms,
stars, galaxies and planets to the vast, dilute, dark
future in which all of these will have died. 

The universe, the cosmologists say, was born 14 billion
years ago in the Big Bang. Most of its material remains
resides in huge clouds of invisible so-called dark matter,
perhaps elementary particles left over from the primordial
explosion and not yet identified. 

Within these invisible clouds, the glittery lights in the
sky that have defined creation for generations of humans
are swamped, like flecks of foam on a rolling sea. A good
case can be made, scientists now agree, that the universe
will go on expanding forever. 

In fact, recent observations have suggested that the
expansion of the universe is speeding up over cosmic time,
under the influence of a ""dark energy"" even more mysterious
than dark matter. 

Recently, a group of astronomers led by Dr. William
Percival at the University of Edinburgh combined data from
a variety of observations to compile, based on the simplest
theoretical model, what they say is the most precise
enumeration yet of the parameters that cosmologists have
been fighting about for all these decades. 

The universe, they calculated, is 13.89 billion years old,
plus or minus half a billion years. Only 4.8 percent of it
is made of ordinary matter. Matter of all types, known and
unknown, luminous and dark, accounts for just 27.5 percent.
The rest of creation, 72.5 percent, is the mysterious dark
energy, they reported in a paper submitted last month to
The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 

It is a picture that in some ways is surprisingly simple,
satisfying long-held theoretical prejudices about how the
universe should be designed. Continued agreement with
coming experiments may mean that science is approaching the
end of a ""great program"" of cosmological tests that began
in the 1930's, Dr. P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton and Dr.
Bharat Ratra of Kansas State University said in the draft
of a coming article for The Reviews of Modern Physics. 

In other ways this new dark universe is utterly baffling, a
road map to new mysteries. Dr. Marc Davis, a cosmologist at
the University of California at Berkeley, called it ""a
universe chock full of exotics that don't make sense to
anybody."" 

Moreover there are some questions that scientists still do
not know how to ask, let alone answer, scientifically. Was
there anything before the Big Bang? Is there a role for
life in the cosmos? Why is there something rather than
nothing at all? Will we ever know? 

""We know much, but we still understand very little,"" said
Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of
Chicago. 

The Big Question 

Expanding Forever, 
Or Big Crunch? 

The dim caves of Lascaux, the plains of
Stonehenge and the dreamtime tales of Australian aborigines
all testify to the need to explain the world and existence.
This quest took its present form in 1917. That was when
Albert Einstein took his new general theory of relativity,
which explained how matter and energy warp space-time to
produce gravity, and applied it to the universe. 

Einstein discovered that the cosmos as his theory described
it would be unstable, prone to collapse under its own
gravity. Astronomers, however, were sure that the universe
was stable. So Einstein added a fudge factor that he called
the cosmological constant to his equations. It acted as a
long-range repulsive force to counterbalance gravity. 

In 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the
universe was expanding. The sky was full of distant
galaxies all rushing away from us and one another, as if
propelled by what the British astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle
later called derisively a ""big bang."" The universe was not
stable and, thus, did not require counterbalancing.
Einstein abandoned his constant, referring to it as his
biggest blunder. But it would return to haunt cosmologists,
and the universe. 

Hoyle's term stuck, and the notion of an explosive genesis
became orthodoxy in 1965, when Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr.
Robert Wilson, radio astronomers at Bell Laboratories,
discovered a faint uniform radio glow that pervaded the
sky. It was, cosmologists concluded, the fading remnant of
the primordial fireball itself. 

Relieved of their fudge factor, the equations describing
Einstein's universe were simple. Dr. Allan Sandage, the
Carnegie Observatories astronomer, once called cosmology
""the search for two numbers"" - one, the Hubble constant,
telling how fast the universe is expanding, and the other
telling how fast the expansion is slowing, and thus whether
the universe will expand forever or not. 

The second number, known as the deceleration parameter,
indicated how much the cosmos had been warped by the
density of its contents. In a high-density universe, space
would be curved around on itself like a ball. Such a
universe would eventually stop expanding and fall back
together in a big crunch that would extinguish space and
time, as well as the galaxies and stars that inhabit them.
A low-density universe, on the other hand, would have an
opposite or ""open"" curvature like a saddle, harder to
envision, and would expand forever. 

In between with no overall warpage at all was a
""Goldilocks"" universe with just the right density to expand
forever but more and more slowly, so that after an infinite
time it would coast to a stop. This was a ""flat"" universe
in the cosmological parlance, and to many theorists the
simplest and most mathematically beautiful solution of all.


But the sky did not yield those cosmic numbers easily, even
with the help of the 200-inch Hale telescope on Palomar
Mountain in Southern California, dedicated in 1948, which
had been built largely for that task. Dr. Hubble wrote of
measuring shadows and searching ""among ghostly errors of
measurement for landmarks that are scarcely more
substantial."" 

The Dark Side 

Invisible Matter 
Molds Galaxies 


It was not till the mid-70's, a
quarter-century after the Palomar giant began operating,
that groups of astronomers reached the tentative conclusion
that the universe they could see - stars, gas, planets and
galaxies - did not have nearly enough gravitational oomph
to stop the cosmic expansion. 

""So the universe will continue to expand forever and
galaxies will get farther and farther apart, and things
will just die,"" Dr. Sandage said at the time. 

But the Great Argument was just beginning. Apparently there
was a lot of the universe that astronomers could not see.
The stars and galaxies, were moving as if immersed in the
gravity of giant invisible clouds of so-called dark matter
- ""missing matter"" the Swiss astronomer Dr. Fritz Zwicky
labeled it in the 1930's. 

Many galaxies, for example, are rotating so fast that they
would fly apart unless they were being reined in by the
gravity of halos of dark matter, according to pioneering
observations by Dr. Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington and her colleagues. Her measurements
indicated that these dark halos outweighed the visible
galaxies themselves from 5 to 10 times. But there could be
even more dark matter farther out in space, perhaps enough
to stop the expansion of the universe, eventually, some
theorists suggested. Luminous matter, the Darth Vaders of
the sky said, is like the snow on mountaintops. 

But what is the dark matter? While some of it is gas or
dark dim objects like stars and planets, cosmologists
speculate that most of it is subatomic particles left over
from the Big Bang. 

Many varieties of these particles are predicted by theories
of high-energy physics. But their existence has not been
confirmed or detected in particle accelerators. 

""We theorists can invent all sorts of garbage to fill the
universe,"" Dr. Sheldon Glashow, a Harvard physicist and
Nobel laureate, told a gathering on dark matter in 1981. 

Collectively known as WIMP's, for weakly interacting
massive particles, such particles would not respond to
electromagnetism, the force responsible for light, and thus
would be unable to radiate or reflect light. They would
also be relatively slow-moving, or ""cold"" in physics
jargon, and thus also go by the name of cold dark matter. 

As Earth in its travels passed through the dark-matter
cloud that presumably envelops the Milky Way, the particles
would shoot through our bodies, rarely leaving a trace,
like moonlight through a window. 

But the collective gravity of such particles, cosmologists
say, would shape the cosmos and its contents. 

Gathering along the fault lines laid down by random
perturbations of density in the early universe, dark matter
would congeal into clouds with about the mass of 100,000
Suns. The ordinary matter that was mixed in with it would
cool and fall to the centers of the clouds and light up as
stars. 

The clouds would then attract other clouds. Through a
series of mergers over billions of years, smaller clouds
would assemble into galaxies, and the galaxies would then
assemble themselves into clusters of thousands of galaxies,
and so forth. 

Using the Hubble and other telescopes as time machines -
light travels at a finite speed, so the farther out
astronomers look the farther back in time they see -
cosmologists have begun to confirm that the universe did
assemble itself from the ""bottom up,"" as the dark matter
model predicts. 

Last year, two teams of astronomers reported seeing the
first stars burning their way out of the cloudy aftermath
of the Big Bang, when the universe was only 900 million
years old. The bulk of galaxy formation occurred when the
universe was a half to a quarter its present age,
cosmologists say. 

""The big news in the last decade is that even half a
universe ago the universe looked pretty different,"" said
Dr. Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in
Pasadena. Galaxies before then were small and irregular,
with no sign of the majestic spiral spider webs that
decorate the sky today. 

We would barely recognize our own Milky Way galaxy, if we
could see it five billion years ago when the Sun formed, he
said. 

""By eight billion years back, it would be unrecognizable,""
said Dr. Dressler. 

Yet there are still many questions that the cold dark
matter model does not answer. Astronomers still do not
know, for example, how the first stars formed or why the
models of dark matter distribution don't quite fit in the
cores of some kinds of galaxies. Nor have the dark matter
particles themselves been unambiguously detected or
identified, despite continuing experiments. 

Some astronomers suggest that the discrepancies stem from
the inability of simple mathematical models to deal with
messy details of the real world. 

""It's a huge mystery exactly how stars form,"" Dr. Richard
Bond of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics
said. ""We can't solve it now. So it's even harder to try to
solve them back then."" 

But others, notably Dr. Mordehai Milgrom, a theorist at the
Weizmann Institute in Israel, have suggested that modifying
the gravitational laws by which dark matter was deduced in
the first place would alleviate the need for dark matter
altogether. 

The Bang's Fuel 

Inflating One Ounce 
To a Whole Universe 


Clues to what had actually exploded
in the Big Bang emerged as an unexpected gift from another
great scientific quest: physicists' pursuit for a so-called
theory of everything that would unite all physical
phenomena in a single equation. Unable to build machines
powerful enough to test their most ambitious notions on
Earth, some theorists turned to the sky. 

""The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator,"" Dr.
Jakob Zeldovich, an influential Russian cosmologist, said. 

Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world
today - gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak
nuclear forces. But they suspect, based on data from
particle accelerators and high-powered theory, that those
are simply different manifestations of a single unified
force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
moments. 

As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was
a fall from grace, and the laws of physics evolved, with
one force after another ""freezing out,"" or splitting away. 

In 1979, Dr. Alan Guth, now at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, realized that a hypothesized glitch in this
process would have had drastic consequences for the
universe. Under some circumstances, a glass of water can
stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
freeze, releasing latent heat in the process. Similarly,
the universe could ""supercool"" and stay in a unified state
too long. In that case, space itself would become
temporarily imbued with a mysterious kind of latent heat,
or energy. 

Inserted into Einstein's equations, the latent energy would
act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow
itself apart, Dr. Guth discovered in a calculation in 1979.


In far less than the blink of an eye, 10-37 second, a speck
much smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size
of a grapefruit and then resumed its more stately
expansion, with all of normal cosmic history before it,
resulting in today's observable universe - a patch of sky
and stars 14 billion light-years across. All, by the
magical-seeming logic of Einstein's equations, from about
an ounce of primordial stuff. 

""The universe,"" Dr. Guth liked to say, ""might be the
ultimate free lunch."" 

Dr. Guth called his theory inflation. Inflation, as Dr.
Guth pointed out, explains why the universe is expanding.
Dr. Turner of the University of Chicago referred to it as
""the dynamite behind the Big Bang."" 

As modified and improved by Dr. Andrei Linde, now at
Stanford, and by Dr. Paul Steinhardt, now at Princeton and
Dr. Andreas Albrecht now at the University of California at
Davis, inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology ever
since. One of its great virtues, cosmologists say, is that
inflation explains the origin of galaxies, the main
citizens of the cosmos. The answer comes from the
paradoxical-sounding quantum rules that govern subatomic
affairs. On the smallest scales, according to quantum
theory, nature is lumpy, emitting even energy in little
bits and subject to an irreducible randomness. As a result,
so-called quantum fluctuations would leave faint lumps in
the early universe. These would serve as the gravitational
seeds for future galaxies and other cosmic structures. 

As a result of such successes, cosmologists have stuck with
the idea of inflation, even though, lacking the ability to
test their theories at the high energies of the Big Bang,
they have no precise theory about what might have actually
caused it. ""Inflation is actually a class of theories,""
said Dr. Guth. 

In the latest version, called ""chaotic inflation,"" Dr.
Linde has argued that quantum fluctuations in a myriad of
theorized force fields could have done the trick. 

Indeed, he and others now say they believe that inflation
can occur over and over, spawning an endless chain of
universes out of one another, like bubbles within bubbles. 

""The universe inflates on top of itself,"" Dr. Linde told a
physics conference this spring in Princeton. ""It's
happening right now."" 

The Golden Age 

New Devices Detect 
Primordial Glow 
If the inflationary
theorists are right, the universe we see, the 14 billion
light-years, is just a tiny piece of a much vaster
universe, or even a whole ensemble of them, forever out of
our view. 

According to the theory, therefore, our own little patch of
the cosmos should appear geometrically ""flat,"" the way a
section of a balloon looks flat when viewed close up. This
was the universe long thought to be the most beautiful and
simple. 

But it required, by the logic of Einstein's general
relativity, that there be much more dark matter, or
something, to the universe, enough to ""flatten"" space-time,
than astronomers had found. 

In fact, this prescription was so hard to reconcile with
other observations, of galaxies and their evolutions, that
by 1991 some astronomers and press reports suggested that
the entire theoretical edifice of inflation to blow up the
universe and cold dark matter to fill it, not to say the
Big Bang itself, might have to be junked. 

So it was with a sigh of relief that cosmologists greeted
the announcement in April 1992 that NASA's Cosmic
Background Explorer, or COBE, satellite had succeeded in
discerning faint blotches in the primordial cosmic radio
glow. 

These were the seeds from which, inflation predicted, large
cosmic structures would eventually grow. 

""If you're religious, it's like seeing God,"" said Dr.
George Smoot, a physicist from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory who led the COBE team. 

Astronomers say COBE signaled a transition in which heroic
ideas about the universe began to be replaced by heroic
data, as long-planned new telescopes and other instruments
went into operation. 

A year later, skywalking astronauts corrected the Hubble
telescope's myopic vision. The cosmic background radiation
has come in for particular scrutiny from new radio
telescopes mounted in balloons and on mountaintops. The
news has been good, though not decisive, for inflation. 

For three years, a series of increasingly high-resolution
observations has confirmed that the pattern of blotches
stippling the remnant of the primordial fireball is
consistent with the predictions from inflation and cold
dark matter. The instruments have now mapped details small
enough to have been the seeds of modern clusters of
galaxies. 

""I'm completely snowed by the cosmic background radiation,""
Dr. Guth said. ""The signal was so weak it wasn't even
detected until 1965, and now they're measuring fluctuations
of one part in 100,000."" 

Perhaps most important, the analysis of the fluctuations
indicates that the universe has a ""flat"" geometry, as
predicted by inflation. That was a triumph. Although
observations could not prove that inflation was right, a
nonflat universe would have been a blow to the theory, and
to cosmological orthodoxy. 

""Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the
earliest moments of creation, passed its first very
important test,"" Dr. Turner said at the time. 

The most precise measurements of the cosmic background, at
least in the near future, are generally expected to come
late this year from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Project, or
MAP, satellite, which was launched into space last year on
June 30. MAP will be followed by the European Space
Agency's Planck satellite, in 2006. 

It is highly unlikely that MAP or Planck will be able to
detect what Dr. Turner calls ""the smoking gun signature of
inflation."" The violent stretching of the universe should
roil space-time with so-called gravitational waves that
would leave a faint imprint on the cosmic fireball. 

Detecting those waves would not only confirm inflation, but
also might help scientists establish what caused the
inflation in the first place, giving science its first look
at the strange physics that prevailed when creation was
only about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of
a second old. 

The Universe's Fate 

Bleak Implications 
Of `Dark Energy' 

In 1998, two competing teams of
astronomers startled the scientific world with the news
that the expansion of the universe seemed to be speeding up
under the influence of a mysterious antigravity that seems
embedded in space itself and that is hauntingly reminiscent
of Einstein's old, presumably discredited, cosmological
constant. 

""Dark energy,"" the phenomenon was quickly named. 

If dark
energy is real and the acceleration continues, the galaxies
will eventually speed away from one another so quickly that
they couldn't see one another. The universe would become
cold and empty as the continued acceleration sucked away
the energy needed for life and thought. 

It would be ""the worst possible universe,"" for the quality
and quantity of life, said Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist
at Case Western Reserve University. 

Dr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, called the discovery of dark energy ""the
strangest experimental finding since I've been in physics.""


The discovery was a surprise to the astronomers involved.
Neither team had expected to find the universe
accelerating. They had each set out to measure by how much
the expansion of the universe was slowing because of the
gravity of its contents and thus settle the question of its
fate. 

One team was led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at
Lawrence Berkeley. The other team was a band of astronomers
led by Dr. Brian Schmidt of Mount Stromlo and the Siding
Spring Observatory in Australia. 

Each group employed far-flung networks of telescopes,
including the Hubble, and the Internet to find and monitor
certain exploding stars, or supernovas, as cosmic beacons.
Such explosions, the death rattles of massive stars, are
powerful enough to be seen clear across the universe when
the universe was younger and, presumably, expanding faster.


Leapfrogging each other across the universe, the two teams,
propitiously for their credibility, arrived at the same
answer at the same time: the cosmos was not slowing at all;
it was speeding up. 

Dr. Perlmutter, who had once resented the competition,
conceded, ""With only one group, it would have been a lot
harder to get the community to buy into such a surprising
result."" 

""This was a very strange result,"" said Dr. Adam Riess, a
member of Dr. Schmidt's team. ""It was the opposite of what
we thought we were doing."" 

The results have sent Einstein's old cosmological constant
to the forefront of cosmology. Despite his disavowal, the
constant had never really gone away and had in fact been
given new life by quantum physics. Einstein had famously
rejected quantum's randomness, saying God didn't play dice.


But it justified, in retrospect, his fudge factor. 

According to the uncertainty principle, a pillar of quantum
theory, empty space was not empty, but rather foaming with
the energy of so-called virtual particles as they flashed
in and out of existence on borrowed energy. This so-called
vacuum energy could repel, just like Einstein's old
cosmological constant, or attract. 

The case for dark energy got even stronger a year later,
when the cosmic background observations reported evidence
of a flat universe. Because astronomers had been able to
find only about a third as much matter, both dark and
luminous, as was needed by Einstein's laws to create a flat
geometry, something else had to be adding to it. 

The discovery of dark energy exemplified Dr. Zeldovich's
view of the universe as the poor man's particle
accelerator, and it caught the physicists flat-footed,
somewhat to the pride of the astronomers. 

""A coming of age of astronomy,"" Dr. Dressler called it.


What is dark energy? The question now hangs over the
universe. 

Is it really Einstein's old fudge factor returned to haunt
his children? In that case, as the universe expands and the
volume of space increases, astronomers say, the push
because of dark energy will also increase, accelerating the
galaxies away from one another faster and faster, leading
to a dire dark future. 

Other physicists, however, have pointed out that the
theories of modern physics are replete with mysterious
force fields, collectively called ""quintessence,"" that
might or might not exist, but that could temporarily
produce negative gravity and mimic the action of a
cosmological constant. In that case, all bets on the future
are off. The universe could accelerate and then decelerate,
or vice versa as the dark energy fields rose or fell. 

A third possibility is that dark energy does not exist at
all, in which case not just the future, but the whole
carefully constructed jigsaw puzzle of cosmology, might be
in doubt. The effects of cosmic acceleration could be
mimicked, astronomers say, by unusual dust in the far
universe or by unsuspected changes in the characteristics
of supernovas over cosmic time. As a result, more groups
are joining the original two teams in the hunt for new
supernovas and other ways to measure the effects of dark
energy on the history of the universe. 

Dr. Perlmutter has proposed building a special satellite
telescope, the Supernova Astronomy Project, to investigate
exactly when and how abruptly the cosmic acceleration
kicked in. 

The Nagging QuestionsA Grand Synthesis, 
But Hardly Complete 
For all the new answers being
harvested, some old questions linger, and they have now
been joined by new ones. 

A flat universe is the most mathematically appealing
solution of Einstein's equations, cosmologists agree. But
they are puzzled by the specific recipe, large helpings of
dark matter and dark energy, that nature has chosen. Dr.
Turner called it ""a preposterous universe."" 

But Dr. Martin Rees, a Cambridge University cosmologist,
said that the discovery of a deeper principle governing the
universe and, perhaps, life, may alter our view of what is
fundamental. Some features of the universe that are now
considered fundamental - like the exact mixture of dark
matter, dark energy and regular stuff in the cosmos - may
turn out to be mere accidents of evolution in one out of
the many, many universes allowed by eternal inflation. 

""If we had a theory, then we would know whether there were
many big bangs or one,"" Dr. Rees said. The answers to these
and other questions, many scientists suspect, have to await
the final unification of physics, a theory that reconciles
Einstein's relativity, which describes the shape of the
universe, to the quantum chaos that lives inside it. 

Such a theory, quantum gravity, is needed to describe the
first few moments of the universe, when it was so small
that even space and time should become fuzzy and
discontinuous. 

For two decades, many physicists have placed their bets for
quantum gravity on string theory, which posits that
elementary particles are tiny strings vibrating in a 10- or
11-dimensional space. Each kind of particle, in a sense,
corresponds to a different note on the string. 

In principle, string theory can explain all the forces of
nature. But even its adherents concede that their equations
are just approximations to an unknown theory that they call
M-theory, with ""M"" standing for matrix, magic, mystery or
even mother, as in ""mother of all theories."" Moreover, the
effects of ""stringy physics"" are only evident at energies
forever beyond the limits of particle accelerators. 

Some string theorists have ventured into cosmology, hoping,
to discover some effect that would show up in the poor
man's particle accelerator, the sky. 

In addition to strings, the theory also includes membranes,
or ""branes,"" of various dimensions. Our universe can be
envisioned as such a brane floating in higher-dimensional
space like a leaf in a fish tank, perhaps with other brane
universes nearby. These branes could interact
gravitationally or even collide, setting off the Big Bang. 

In one version suggested last year by four cosmologists
led by Dr. Steinhardt of Princeton, another brane would
repeatedly collide with our own. They pass back and forth
through each other, causing our universe to undergo an
eternal chain of big bangs. 

Such notions are probably the future for those who are paid
to wonder about the universe. 

And the fruits of this work could yet cause cosmologists to
reconsider their new consensus, warned Dr. Peebles of
Princeton, who has often acted as the conscience of the
cosmological community, trying to put the brakes on faddish
trends. 

He wonders whether the situation today can be compared to
another historical era, around 1900, when many people
thought that physics was essentially finished and when the
English physicist Lord Kelvin said that just a couple of
""clouds"" remained to be dealt with. 

""A few annoying tidbits, which turned out to be relativity
and quantum theory,"" the twin revolutions of 20th-century
science, Dr. Peebles said. 

Likewise, there are a few clouds today like what he called
""the dark sector,"" which could have more complicated
physics than cosmologists think. 

""I'm not convinced these clouds herald revolutions as deep
as relativity and quantum mechanics,"" Dr. Peebles said.
""I'm not arguing that they won't."" 

As for the fate of the universe, we will never have a firm
answer, said Dr. Sandage, who was Hubble's prot�g� and has
seen it all. 

""It's like asking, `Does God exist?' "" he said.


Predicting the future, he pointed out, requires faith that
simple mathematical models really work to describe the
universe. 

""I don't think we really know how things work,"" he said.


Although Dr. Sandage does not buy into all aspects of the
emerging orthodoxy, he said it was a fantastic time to be
alive. 

""It's all working toward a much grander synthesis than we
could have imagined 100 years ago,"" he said. ""I think this
is the most exciting life I could have had.""

Well, IMNHO, its because companies do not reward knowledge sharers. When 
time comes for evaluation, there isn't a line on the page saying ""Helped 
others to succeed with their projects."" Sharing inevitably cuts into the 
time for personal productive work, and generally shows up as a red flag

And yet, in my experience, it still happens, but always ""unofficially""
and ""off the record"".  It's as if we believe that ""the gods"" will
punish us if we are seen to have behaved in a human fashion while on
company time, either by being caught red-handed, or having the

when things actually do happen.

With all the spam that gets through, I had no idea

Turn it off! It not only risks silent false 
positives, but suffers them in such a way that 
individuals cannot adjust/detect/remedy them. 

Also, anti-spam startups need end-users. 
Centralized spam fighting takes food out
of those coders' mouths!

I still think self-add whitelists are underrated. 
A FoRK whitelist would presumably start with
all subscribers, and grow from there. Bouncing
problem mail, in a way that humans can understand
how to whitelist themselves for a resend, avoids 
the problem of silent failures without opening the 
door to lazy, forged-""from"" spammers.

Wait... I didn't think we had any filters set up on FoRK.
Kragen, do you know of any?

I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org)
that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes
anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post,
no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting.

For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin,
or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them.
So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even
if it looks like spam.

So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I
guess I would have received it in a timely fashion.

So where's all that booze? When's the retry?

Lately, a fairly large % of the spam I've been getting has been coming from
spam systems that forge my own address as the ""from"" address... Those spam
messages would get through any whitelist I set up (especially since I email
stuff to myself all the time).  If whitelists become more popular, I
imagine spammers will resort to doing that for the majority of their spams,
making whitelists less helpful.

Plus, I'm still not sure how I feel about whitelists.  I don't think I'm so

email.  I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed
(especially those with multiple email addresses...).

Include a random token with an expiration date with anything you send.  
Valid whitelisting of From:you@here.net yet invalid random token would get

Spammers cannot be bothered to keep track if individual whitelists

Of course you populate your whitelist with contents of your inbox minus 
spam, and then add manually stuff from your addressbook.

Just Ask the Experts
By Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon 07/23/2002


In 2001 the National Science Foundation surveyed 1,500 people nationwide
and found that 77% believed that ""increased carbon dioxide and other gases
released into the atmosphere will, if unchecked, lead to global warming
..."" Yet half of those polled believed that humans and dinosaurs co-existed
on Earth, despite the scientific fact that the dinosaurs went extinct tens
of millions of years before the earliest hominids appeared. Worse, only 22%
of the respondents understood what a molecule - for example, carbon dioxide
- is.

As in the case of the belief by many that dinosaurs and early humans
co-existed, public opinion does not change the actual facts about the
material world. Such a poll measures nothing more than the degree of public
ignorance about scientific matters.

Most people get news stories about science and technology developments from
television. And after more than a decade of being fed what-if stories about
global warming from human activities, no wonder most people ""believe"" that
global warming ""will"" occur. However, on the anxiety scale, only 33% ""worry
a great deal"" about global warming, a worry that ranks at 12 out of 13
environmental concerns. The top environmental fear, shared by 64% of those
polled, was polluted drinking water.

So What Do We Know?

Concerning the latest understanding on human-made global warming, here are
three points we know from the science:

   1. The surface record of temperature from thermometers show widespread
warming in the 20th century compared to the 19th. There was one period of
warming early in the 20th century, the second after the 1970s. Ecosystems
have responded to this widespread warmth, not seen since ca. 800 - 1200 C.E.

      But the cause of global surface warming cannot be associated with
human activity without additional information. Some media reports point to
ecosystem responses of 20th century warmth (e.g., mountain glacier retreat)
and unjustifiably claim the responses owe to man-made causes. But mountain
glaciers receded during the past period of warmth around 1,000 years ago,
and advanced during the unusual cold of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1300 - 1900
C.E.). Both those climate shifts occurred naturally, before the increased
concentration of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.


    # All computer simulations of climate say that in order to conclude
that the surface global warming trend is human caused, the surface warmth
must be accompanied by an equal or larger warming trend in the air from one
to five miles in height. Measurements made by satellites and verified from
weather balloons show no meaningful human-made warming trend over the last
two or even four decades. Thus, the recent warming trend in the surface
temperature record cannot be caused by the increase of human-made
greenhouse gases in the air.


    # The computer simulations are not reliable as tools for explaining
past climate or making projections for future trends.



Future Shock: The Scenarios

When it comes to future scenarios, consider what the experts actually say
about potential climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change writes in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
(2000), ""Scenarios are images of the future or alternative futures. They
are neither predictions nor forecasts."" Further, ""The possibility that any
single emissions path will occur as described in the scenario is highly
uncertain,"" and finally, ""No judgement is offered in this Report as to the
preference for any of the scenarios and they are not assigned probabilities
of occurrence, neither must they be interpreted as policy recommendations.""

Forecasting future societal conditions and energy use often amount to
little more than unconvincing guesses. Jesse Ausebel at Rockefeller
University in April 2002 critiqued the U.N. IPCC's "" ... 40 energy
scenarios, with decarbonization, or carbonization, sloping every which way
and no probabilities attached. ... It is a confession that collectively
they know nothing, that no science underlies their craft, and that politics
strongly bias their projections.""

Nonetheless, such a guess about the world's energy future forms the first
step in making a 100-year prediction of global warming. That first
uncertain forecast - future energy use - used as input in the climate
simulation surely compounds the uncertainty in the next step, the climate
forecast.

Inability to predict the future should not be surprising. The climate
simulations upon which predictions are based yield unreliable results
because, as outlined above, the results are incompatible with measurements
of how the climate has changed in the last few decades.

Complete Speculation

On May 24, 1994, Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of
Meteorology at MIT, testified to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources, ""The claims about catastrophic consequences of significant
global warming, should it occur at all, are almost completely speculative.
Not only are they without any theoretical foundations, but they frequently
involved assuming the opposite of what appears to happen.""

Despite years of solid work by climate specialists, the output of computer
simulations remains undependable, owing to the extraordinary complexity of
the natural world. Thus, on May 1, 2001 Lindzen testified to the Senate
Commerce Committee about the long-standing inability of computer
simulations to deliver results that resemble reality, even in the cases
where good measurements are available:

""For example, there is widespread agreement [among climate scientists] ...
that large computer climate models are unable to even simulate major
features of past climate such as the 100 thousand year cycles of ice ages
that have dominated climate for the past 700 thousand years, and the very
warm climates of the Miocene [23 to 5 million years ago], Eocene [57 to 35
million years ago], and Cretaceous [146 to 65 million years ago]. Neither
do they do well at accounting for shorter period and less dramatic
phenomena like El Ninos, quasi-biennial oscillations, or intraseasonal
oscillations - all of which are well documented in the data, and important
contributors to natural variability.""
Lindzen explained the failure of computer simulations simply in May 2000:

""The point I am making is that it is a fallacious assumption that the
models have everything in them, and will display it, and somehow the rest
is just technical uncertainty. There are things they literally don't have.""
This punctuates the popular notion that averaging output from computer
results will somehow, miraculously, give a scientifically appropriate
result.

Think Locally

Now, on top of the unreliable forecasts of global warming -- which rest on
""highly uncertain"" forecasts of future economic and social conditions and
un-validated climate simulations -- come the forecasts of local impacts, in
order to make the case for relevancy to people. Increased storminess is one
prediction of the outcome of human-made global warming found in the popular
media, which would be where most people learn about the issue.

The idea that storminess increases with human-made global warming defies
expert opinion. David Legates, an expert hydrology researcher, testified in
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on March 13, 2002:

""Ascertaining anthropogenic changes to these extreme weather events is
nearly impossible. Climate models cannot even begin to simulate storm-scale
systems, let alone model the full range of year-to-year variability...
Clearly, claims that anthropogenic global warming will lead to more
occurrences of droughts, floods, and storms are wildly exaggerated.""
The U.N. IPCC Third Assessment Report concurs, ""[T]here is currently
insufficient information to assess recent trends, and climate models
currently lack the spatial detail required to make confident projections.
For example, very small-scale phenomena, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes,
hail and lightning, are not simulated in climate models (Summary for
Policymakers, p. 15).""

A group of extremely relevant experts, the American Association of State
Climatologists, recently summarized the state of climate simulations:

""Climate prediction is complex with many uncertainties ... For time scales
of a decade or more, understanding the empirical accuracy of such
predictions - called ""verification"" - is simply impossible, since we have
to wait a decade or longer to assess the accuracy of the forecasts. ...
climate predictions have not demonstrated skill in projecting future
variability and changes in such important climate conditions as growing
season, drought, flood-producing rainfall, heat waves, tropical cyclones
and winter storms. These are the type of events that have a more
significant impact on society than annual average global temperature
trends.""
On the facts of human-made global warming, should one believe television or
the experts?

About the only way I've heard of something like this working was back in

That might do the trick, though I don't know what happened to QuadGraphics...

I agree wholeheartedly.  It is easier to sit on knowledge than to
continually acquire more on the frontiers.

This is in fact very true.  People hate doing this for several reasons in
my experience:
1) ""Software changes.   Why waste time writing a FAQ now that will be out
of date at the next release in 3 months?""
2) ""This knowledge is specialized.  Only 4 people need to know this, and
they already do.  If anyone else needs to know it they know who they can
call.""
The same engineers who give these excuses will spend eternities on the
phone discussing this arcana and sharing the knowledge with anyone who has
the patience to ask.

The strongest contributors freely share everything they know whenever
asked (or whenever they see the need for the information in the company)
and who at the same time continue to generate new knowledge.

Personal evaluation: my worth comes slightly lower on the scale in that I
synthesize the knowledge from various personal sharing exercises into
usable documents and messages for the company to employ.  This would seem
like a marketing exercise except that Marketing is useless.   Useful
knowledge sharing comes (IMHO) from engineering and sales.

It's quite a bit more than natural selection; the times had a
fascinating article a few months back (possibly posted as bits here)
that note that one Holstein bull who died in the 70s is paternally
related to something like 40% of the world's cattle. That's way, way
more than natural selection, and (given the difficulty and expense of
isolating specific genes for size, industrial-living-ness, etc.) more
expansive than raw gene manipulation will be for some time.

They know bull semen, and the burger you ate at lunch may have had its 
sire's contribution to its genetics purchased through them.

My ex-wife worked in their lab for a year while I was in gradual school. 
We had boxes of masking tape from ABS pre-printed with the names and 
serial numbers of 'decomissioned' bulls.

They are also known for the hideous puns on their sign just outside of

1997. Set in the old west.

A cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly 
surrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians 
take the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the 
tribe deals with their victims:
Each day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to 
grant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible 
slow death. Time for your first wish.

The cowboy thinks a bit, and says ""I want to talk to my horse."" So the 
indians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the 
horse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a 
beautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, 
appropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.

The next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at 
yesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says ""I want to 
talk to my horse"". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in 
its ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes 
back, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy 
and the women go in the tent, ..., etc.

On the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are 
eager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, 
and the cowboy again says ""I want to talk to my horse."" The horse is 
brought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, 
stares right at him, and says -- ""Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!""

So here's the final report on the HD/ID party. As no less than TEN

delivered ten days later on 7/9.

It got flagged as spam.

quarantined just two posts that week, one from me that was > 100K (the

Now, it was a little difficult to recalibrate self-esteem, which as you 
can imagine was proportional to the two-digit attendance  -- in binary!

According to the George Washington documentary, I almost had as much 
alcohol on hand than he did -- Virginia tradition being to copiously 
lubricate each voter. Election day was a public festival day, and it 
cost poor George an average of SIXTY-FOUR shots of hard liquor PER VOTER 
that day...

So, herewith is the prize for most appropriate flame my delayed invite

Perhaps I should remind the latter gently that it was not in any way his

Besides lists, this is the reason I can't use such a system. I get more

Of course was genetic engineering. It used the fundamental mechanism of 
genetics (inheritance of traits), and not randomly, but 
intentionally--breeding for long fur, fat hams, whatever. The degree to which 
the engineers--farmers, breeders--understood exactly how the mehcanism works 
is only marginally relevant to the question of whether it was engineering. 
Science progresses. Over the years, centuries, their, our, knowledge 
increased, and domestication became more effective. Bit by bit the mechanisms 
became known--Mendel making a major breakthrough. The first hybrid grains 
(which date from the 1920s) represent another step. Watson and Crick another, 
etc. But it's engineering--just as Roman architecture was civil engineering, 
even if they knew less about the mathematics behind it than we do today, just 
as Galen was a physician, though laughably ignorant by our standards.

They don't have to.  All they have to do is use some program (which, if
they don't exist already, will certainly be around someday soon) that makes
every spam they send show the recipient as the ""from"" address as well.

The adding manually thing doesn't seem like much fun.  And, anytime I speak

contact me.  Having played around with whitelists in the past, you'd be

Well, yes.  *I* use one email address, but that doesn't mean all my friends
do.  You would need to convince everyone I know of that.  Most people I
know, at the very least, have a home and work email address.  But plenty
others have other addresses for various reasons.  Keeping track of all of
them for a whitelist seems like a pain.  It forces them to remember which
email addresses are already approved and avoid using others.

Plus, I know plenty of people who change jobs, and suddenly get a new email
address from their new job.  Wouldn't it suck if, in sending out your new
job info, you had to fill out a new application for each friend just to
tell them about your new job email address?

Ah the great spam debate wages on ...

So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-)

Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is
that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school
accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of
mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go
through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends
that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into
the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )  
Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I
haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my
carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets
considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down.
When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or
whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even
_better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change
my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I
can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to
my @hotmail account.

I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only
fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting
to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be
willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist
provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was
referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us
tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the
whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more
knowledgable.

My half a cent here...

<sidenote>: I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving
thing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :)
Woo hoo!   Law school!)   </sidenote>

(plus some anti-French abuse from the usual suspect).

Well my brain doesn't hurt so much any more, and it was well worth it.
I've now got an even faster method for elliptic-curve point counting,
both pratically and asymptotically.

It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O(n^(2+1/2+eps)),
or O(n^(2+eps)) with precomputation.  Before the best methods took
O(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it.
The precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes
time O(n^(3+eps)).  Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding
some logarithmic factors.

After lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the
number of points on the curve.

Here's an example over a 1009-bit field, without precomputation, using
a 1 GHz Pentium III:

Naw, I still disagree, again because if I'm going to be so loose
with the definitions, then I'd have to say that I myself am a
genetically engineered organism.  But I'm natural, baby.  My parents
were attracted to each other's phenotypes, mixed some genes in the
hopes that those genotypes would get in there, and grew me around
them.  Sure, they engineered the process when they selected each
other.  But they didn't engineer the genetics.  If genetic enginering
wasn't such an important topic today, it wouldn't be such an important
distinction.

I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing
against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument -
""we've been doing it since prehistory, so we don't need to apply any
caution today"".

Yes, I'm saying that if he extends ""genetic engineering"" to include
selecting animals to breed, he must extend it to include selecting
people to breed with.

I'm saying that my parents selected each other, and that they did so
because (among other reasons) each wanted the other's genes to be
mixed with their own in the offspring that they were planning.

What does it matter that they were selecting to produce their own
offspring, rather than the offspring of two unrelated animals?

The grain is this.......

Selective breeding, cross polinization, ie  is a MACROgenetic activites.
Your dealing with big structures like whole sheep, plants, seed etc.

Manipulating the actual DNA, protein sequences, etc etc is a MICROgenetic
activity.

MACROgenetic activites have decades on decades of testing...

An interesting idea I heard of was to use gene maps & genetic info
about animals to guide the breeding process - essentially shortening
the iteration time with genetic information, but not touching any

Space rock 'on collision course'

 
An asteroid could devastate Earth

      
      
      By Dr David Whitehouse 
      BBC News Online science editor  
     
     
An asteroid discovered just weeks ago has become the most threatening object yet detected in space. 
A preliminary orbit suggests that 2002 NT7 is on an impact course with Earth and could strike the planet on 1 February, 2019 - although the uncertainties are large. 

Astronomers have given the object a rating on the so-called Palermo technical scale of threat of 0.06, making NT7 the first object to be given a positive value. 

>>From its brightness, astronomers estimate it is about two kilometres wide, large enough to cause continent-wide devastation on Earth. 

Many observations 

Although astronomers say the object definitely merits attention, they expect more observations to show it is not on an Earth-intersecting trajectory. 



      This asteroid has now become the most threatening object in the short history of asteroid detection 
     
      Dr Benny Peiser  
It was first seen on the night of 5 July, picked up by the Linear Observatory's automated sky survey programme in New Mexico, US. 

Since then astronomers worldwide have been paying close attention to it, amassing almost 200 observations in a few weeks. 


Could it be deflected? 
Dr Benny Peiser, of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, told BBC News Online that ""this asteroid has now become the most threatening object in the short history of asteroid detection"". 

NT7 circles the Sun every 837 days and travels in a tilted orbit from about the distance of Mars to just within the Earth's orbit. 

Potential devastation 

Detailed calculations of NT7's orbit suggest many occasions when its projected path through space intersects the Earth's orbit. 

Researchers estimate that on 1 February, 2019, its impact velocity on the Earth would be 28 km a second - enough to wipe out a continent and cause global climate changes. 

However, Dr Peiser was keen to point out that future observations could change the situation. 

He said: ""This unique event should not diminish the fact that additional observations in coming weeks will almost certainly - we hope - eliminate the current threat."" 

Easily observable 

According to astronomers, NT7 will be easily observable for the next 18 months or so, meaning there is no risk of losing the object. 

Observations made over that period - and the fact that NT7 is bright enough that it is bound to show up in old photographs - mean that scientists will soon have a very precise orbit for the object. 

Dr Donald Yeomans, of the US space agency's (Nasa) Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, told BBC News Online: ""The orbit of this object is rather highly inclined to the Earth's orbit so it has been missed because until recently observers were not looking for such objects in that region of space."" 

Regarding the possibility of an impact, Dr Yeomans said the uncertainties were large. 

""The error in our knowledge of where NT7 will be on 1 February, 2019, is large, several tens of millions of kilometres,"" he said. 

Dr Yeomans said the world would have to get used to finding more objects like NT7 that, on discovery, look threatening, but then become harmless. 

""This is because the problem of Near-Earth Objects is now being properly addressed,"" he said.

also includes human pairs that are not randomly grouped.

It doesn't matter if those two intend what they are doing, they are
engaged in a 'selected sort'.  It has been brought up that a boss no

another high earning mate (at least associate law).  So instead of two
couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200
and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects.  And
one of those effects is the difference in their children (on average).

I don't think a ballistic missile defense system will be much help
against a rock a couple thousand kilometers in diameter.  That's WAY
outside the design spec for any such system.  Particularly when
ballistic intercept designs usually don't have any type of warhead
associated with them, either being kinetic or directed energy weapons.

Contrary to popular belief, ballistic missile defense isn't a hard
problem (ignoring whether or not it is useful).  The only real challenge
is materials science, as it really pushes the envelope of materials
performance requirements to places they've never been; there has been
some technology crossover with some of the new materials and processes
they've had to come up with.  The actual discrimination algorithms,
while way more advanced than anything you'll see in the private sector
(and classified, to keep it that way), are usually run on a crusty old
MIPS R3k embedded processor or similar, with a low-to-mid range DSP to
help out. It is not computationally intensive by any means.

I used to be tangentially involved in various ballistic missile
intercept weapon programs many years ago and am pretty familiar with the
technologies that go into them.  Most of the arguments against it from a
technological standpoint are ignorant bullshit, and have lead me to
believe that hardly anyone understands the technical parameters of
ballistic missile intercept.  And the arguments that are made without
reference to the capability of the technology are neither particularly
convincing nor conclusive.

In summary:

1) Ballistic missile intercept technology is useless on a big rock.  You
are much better off using heavy-lift space technology to deliver a big
nuke (or small nuke, depending on your plan). 

2) State-of-the-art ballistic missile intercept technology is far more
competent than most people imagine it is, and has discrimination
capabilities that exceed most popular belief.  It better be -- they've
had twenty years to work on it.

3) I've never heard a really convincing argument against deploying
ballistic missile intercept technology, particularly considering most of
the R&D investment has already been made. I don't really care about it
one way or the other, but I also don't see why other people have fits
over it either.

That doesn't matter.  What does matter
is that they were going on phenotypes,
and didn't engineer the genetics.  That
example makes a good case for natural

One can also view that argument as a case
for checks: livestock owners have, over a
period of millenia, altered the genetics
of their herds to be dumber, meatier, and
more tolerant of industrial living, so if

Yeah, right.  Considering the Genesis project just won an award for

that the issue has been hashed over in sci.astro many, many times,

anything, though, I'd nudge the rock (the one the size of a small
town) as you're less likely to re-define global agriculture that way.

'Course, you're gonna have this problem of distributing the force over
a large enough surface area that it translates into a resillient
compression wave instead of a knifeblade/diamond faultline split.
It's also not a game of billiards, but a 6+ dimensional collision
problem (space, time, spin, temp, maybe electromag too if there's any
heavy metals in it, and there often is) complete with relativistic

blackboxed alien geology to sustained forces in excess of 100 megatons

Hey, that thing is 2 km across and 28 km/s fast. There's nothing you can
do just before the impact with a system that was designed to deal with
tiny ballistic missiles, and largely by damaging them, not destroying
them. Apart from twiddling with the surface albedo which might be not

with nukes. Assymetrical repeated flash-evaporation (anything closer would

It is much more interesting whether you can kill enough of delta v for a

with final stage aerobraking would be far more useful. Otoh, one could as

A bull market climbs a wall of worry -- on record volume.

Yeah, I know, it's different this time. Pay no attention to the bear
behind the curtain, and all that.

However, at the end of the *last* bear market, in 1983 -- yup, that
long ago -- Granville sell-orders caused bloodbaths with boring
regularity, a stockholm-syndrome economy had recently been delivered
of Keynesian monetary apparatchiks at the Fed and elsewhere, and
Henry ""Dr. Doom"" Kauffman opined offhand that interest rates *might*
come down finally... and pop! went the market, sending the NYSE
volume through the roof. (Record volume then was around a hundred
mill. Yesterday, ladies and germs, it was upward of 2 point something
*billion* shares).. Back then, I was a mail-cart-pushing,
key-punching ""administration"" clerk at Morgan Stanley in Chicago,
chief scrounge for a bunch of Masters of the Universe, and everybody
at Morgan thought the resulting price-pop was just a technical rally
and wouldn't last either. :-). Six months later, people *still* said
it wouldn't last, and a girlfriend's uncle was saying that it was too
late, he'd missed the train, so he was going to stay out 'till the
market came back down a bit. By that time, the Dow was at, what,
1600? I wonder if he's still out, waiting...


A 40% decline is a big chunk of change, boys and girls, even if it's
40% of a bubble. Actually, by my count, it's 100% of the bubble, but
that's just me. After all, Amazon and EBay's P/Es still need a
pressurized cabin to breathe in.

So, yes, the market may go lower, but not much more, relatively
speaking. At some point, and fairly soon, I bet, someone's going to
realize that, even though you wouldn't want to actually trade one for
a house, tulips are still nice things to have around.

Hint: Interest rates are rediculuously low, they aren't going up any
time soon, and, if we can survive the election, the recently-started
CEO witch-hunt won't be too much more than Street theater, probably
not resulting in much in the way of regulation or legislation. The
threat of which, frankly, probably caused this recent explosive
decompression in the first place. Your tax dollars at work, if you
will.

So, in light of the erstwhile bloodbath on Capital Hill, and the real
one we just saw a few days ago in the market, it may be time for
people to remember what Mr. Rothschild said, and buy now while
there's blood in the streets.

As to whether the accounting is ""rigged"", remember what Robert
Heinlein said: ""Who cares if the game is rigged? You can't win if you
don't play.""



Cheers,
RAH
The aforementioned girlfriend, by the way, traded *me* in for an
actual Rothschild in 1984, after I insisted on going back to school
and talking my way into the back door at the University of Chicago to
boot. The cost of anything being the foregone alternative, it
sometimes seems to me I'm *still* paying for that detour, but that's
a bear of a different color, and it's okay as long as I don't look
behind the curtain, right? :-).

My estimate is that, in the worst case, we have 17 years (5.4e8
seconds) to move it one earth radius, or about 6000 km (6e6 m).  
a t^2/2 = x, if I remember right, so a = 2x/t^2, which is 
1.2e7 m/(2.9e17 s^2), or about 4.1e-11 m/s^2, which is not a very
large acceleration, roughly equivalent to the gravitational
acceleration in these parts divided by 200000000000.  Assuming a
2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of
specific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12
cubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg.  The force we'd have to
apply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the
weight of 200 kg here on Earth.

So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the
calculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about
four orders of magnitude too small.

If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it
would miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1
cm/s.  A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s,
or about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not
possible.  (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass,
as it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could
still do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything
approaching that speed.)  The impulse required is inversely
proportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it
after half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around
2.2 cm/s instead.

The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide
sufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away
from the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or
about 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU).
(And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.)

The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning
ahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed
acceleration scales with 1/t^2.  After half the time has elapsed, we'd
need four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if
we were to start accelerating it now.

All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a
slightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its
gravity well.  How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile
in ways I don't understand.

They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being
applied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which
is a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five
orders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference
is probably insignificant.)  And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path.

What about electrical charges?  Could we electrically charge the
asteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to
provide the needed acceleration?

Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other
direction, too.  If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton
asteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over
twenty-five years to adjust its orbit.

Luckily, I'm in no such predilection as technolumpen.

However, the signs do seem to head for a much deeper crapper than the one

Well it seems Bruce Perens agrees with me, only he's going one better,
instead of just mouthing off about it, he's going to do it and do it 
in a big way ...


    Open source campaigner to risk jail
    By James Middleton [24-07-2002]

    Bruce Perens plans live DVD hack

    With the dust from the Elcomsoft/Sklyarov case still thick in the
    air, influential open source activist Bruce Perens plans to go one
    better by breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA)
    during a live presentation on Friday.

    Fresh from giving RealNetworks a slating for not completely
    backing open source with its latest announcement, Perens said that
    during a Digital Rights Management presentation to be held Friday
    at the O'Reilly developer conference in San Diego, he would break
    the law.

    The DMCA has been a sore point in the open source community since
    the outlawing of DeCSS, a tool created so that DVDs could be
    played on Linux machines, and more recently since the arrest of
    Dmitry Sklyarov and the criminal charges faced by his employer,
    Elcomsoft.

    Based on the recent history of DMCA contravention, Perens could
    face imprisonment or a $500,000 fine for his actions.

    According to Infoworld the demonstration is to be carried out in
    protest at the regional system used by the motion picture industry
    to prevent DVDs released in one country being played on machines
    in another country.

    During his presentation, Perens will demonstrate how to hack a DVD
    player so that it can play movies from any region.

    ""It is a political and social statement, and the statement is that
    the people do not need to have a hall monitor living in their
    stereo system and should be able to play any kind of media on the
    device they wish,"" he was quoted as saying.

    But luck may be on his side, if last year is anything to go by. At
    the same conference in 2001 Perens made a presentation on the
    triviality of Digital Rights Management systems using exactly the
    same slides that got Sklyarov arrested.

Re: Asteroids anyone ?,"""Jon O."" <jono@networkcommand.com>",bitbitch@magnesium.net,"Thu, 25 Jul 2002 15:48:46 -0700","

Has anyone considered the fact that these occurrances appear to
be increasing. I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding
some and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but 
I'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing
or not. 

Why? Well, it seems to me if we were going to get hit, the one
that does it may have been part of a larger swarm or cluster
which has over the years increased the distance between the
rocks. Like the Schumaker Levy-9, which had multiple rocks
all impacting at different times, others may have this same
type of design and could be in different stages of increasing
distance from one another. Also to consider is if SL-9 was
on course for earth, would we get hit by all rocks or only
one because the earth is a much smaller target than Jupiter?

So, my theory is that if these near earth rocks are increasing
so does our chance of discovering the last three were part of
a swarm of 15 of which 10, 11 and 12 may hit.

To actually answer the question, each of the last three reports was
hurling down a different ""tube"" so, no, they are not related, but yes,
each tube contains an uneven distribution of stuff that only /peaks/
near the biggest chunks.  It would actually be pretty amazing to find
any repeat visitor still in one piece after it's solar perigee.  Space
in that neighbourhood is warped like a cheese-grater.  We can expect
one (or more) really big mother(s), surrounded by lots of cute little
'uns smeared out in the crest of its gravity wave.

Another curious artifact of the old-and-periodic rock data is the
bigger rocks are on the outer edge of the tubes: Relativistic effects
on the redshift/blueshift of the particle solar heating differential
on either side of each bit slow the smaller less-massive (and more
easily pushed) particles dropping them into lower orbits ... or at
least, that's our best theory.

I've seen data that shows 1200 rocks (TV-set sized and smaller)
crashing into the Ottawa skies /every/ /single/ /night/, and that's
just the background noise.  Plots of that data show us passing through
hundreds of 'tubes' of debris, each indicative of some other larger
something out there, only a small handful of which have been
discovered.  This is without even considering the one's headed this
way out of the Oort for their First Big Trip.

One thing you will just have to get used to is hearing news of a
possible collision; we have only started funding the projects to look
for these things since Hollywood took an interest with Armageddon, and
we have only just recently turned on a bunch of new toys to do
automated sky surveys.  There are also some new (and very clever)
amateur projects co-ordinating multiple telescopes to detect these
criters, one of which plans to network dozens of ground based machines
around the world.  You may remember a few years back the 2028 doomsday
story -- consider them good ghost stories, then go back to work.

20,000 years ago, one of them the size of Mt Everest just ever so
slightly grazed us and left a scar 400km long in the side of South
America before it scooted out into space.  First nations people would
have been there then, and it would have seriously ruined their day.
Orbital elements tell us that our modern technology would have perhaps
given us 90-min advance warning.   

The near-miss earlier this month wasn't seen until it was already past
us; we can't detect rocks on their trip behind the Sun, and when they
come out slingshot to relativistic speeds, well, it's just too darn
late to do much of anything about it.  On the inbound trip, even at
their max full-moon angle, these things are most often magnitude 16 or
way worse, which is many magnitudes fainter than what you see in the
deepest dark-skies; no one thought to paint them shiny and white.
They day before it ""hits"" my software says NT7 will be magnitude 14 --
it's easier to see the space station.

What's worse, the Sun is not a smooth hard spheric marble, it's a
twisted gelatinous hunk o' hunk o' burnin' love, so the precise warp
curve of space right near it's backside is (ahem) somewhat problematic
to compute precisely.  It's also spewing considerable plasma flux in
all directions, and then there's all these other big gelatinous roaming
globs (Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune) and some significant roaming
rubble (us), and damn it, they are all spinning too, and most of them
have a magnetosphere!

Good question.  This was covered in one of the amateur rags, maybe Sky
and Telescope or even Scienterrific American, long before there was any
web to speak of, but you'd think a 400km gash in the Earth would be
pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very
late 80's or early 90's.

It's interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on
trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with
the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying
to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different
impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to
70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.  

The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona
(famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the
actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela
sticks in my mind but I can't be certain.

No, it's just we've started looking. After we've actually started looking 
for deep infrasound (pressure waves) with a network of stations designed 
to enforced the nuke test ban treaty we've discovered that pretty big 
impacts are the norm. Current infrasound stations can detect 
bolides/meteoroids in ~10 T TNT scale, but some 10 kT events are 
relatively frequent. A number of people died in the Tunguska event (1908, 
10-15 MT), despite it hitting in the middle of nowhere.

http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:637JrhGDB5gC:www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/5thMars99/pdf/6081.pdf+bolide+impact+kT+wave&hl=en&ie=UTF-8

In the Earth atmosphere a large number of bright light flashes of energies
in light impulse of about 0.1- 1 kt TNT and higher have been registered by
USA DoD satellites equipped with photoelectric detectors [9-11]. Intense
light impulses are created by impacts of meteoroids disrupted in the
atmosphere (mainly at altitudes of about 30-45 km). Several techniques for
the assessment of meteor- oid's characteristics from the light curves and
heights of peak intensities have been developed [3,12]. Using these
techniques the preatmospheric kinetic energy for Fifth International
Conference on Mars INITIATION OF SANDSTORMS: I.V.Nemtchinov, O.P.Popova,
V.A.Rybakov, V.V.Shuvalov a number of events was determined. The biggest
event is the 1 February 1994 with ini- tial energy as high as 30-40 kt TNT
(or initial mass of about 400 t). The bright flash with light energy of
about 4.5 kt TNT was caused by this meteoroid which deeply penetrated into
the atmosphere (at an angle of 45 degrees and velocity of 24 km/s) and
disintegrated above at altitudes of about 34 km and 21 km [9,12]. Another
famous impact event, the Sikhote-Alin meteor shower (12 February 1947
event), may be compared with the 1 February 1994 event. Initial masses of
these meteoroids are probably the same, as well as the angle of trajectory
inclination, but the initial velocity of the Sikhote-Alin is almost twice
smaller. That caused fragmentation of 1 February 1994 meteoroid at higher
altitudes and probably large fragments constitute a smaller part of the
pre- breakdown mass in contrast to the Sikhote-Alin event. In a rarefied
atmosphere of Mars analogous im- pactors will penetrate into deeper layers
of the atmos- phere.They will disintegrate lower 15 km or even reach the
planet surface, partially in disrupted form. Only the first disruption
would occur if a meteoroid similar to that caused the 1 February 1994 will
enter into the Martian atmosphere. And this body would reach the Mars
surface as a tense swarm of fragments. The meteoroid similar to that
caused the Sikhote-Alin event would hit the surface in a form of large
frag- ments due to its low velocity. They will create crater with the size
similar to that of the undisrupted meteoroid.

PlayStation owners win copyright case

Owners of PlayStation consoles who modify their machines to play games
bought overseas have had a win in the Federal Court.

Sony Computer Entertainment has failed in its claim that ""chipping"" breaks
copyright laws.

Sony launched legal proceedings against a Sydney man, Eddy Stevens, for
allegedly selling pirated games and also providing and installing
modification chips.

PlayStation consoles in Australia are different from those in the US and
Japan because of the different television formats.

The court was told ""chipping"" allows people to play legitimately bought
overseas games and copies of games, but also pirated games.

The judgement by Federal Court Justice Ronald Sackville says Sony failed
to prove that PlayStation consoles have a copyright protection measure
installed in the first place and therefore could not rule that a mod chip
breaks copyright legislation.

Mr Stevens was found to have infringed trademark rules in relation to the
pirated games he sold a matter which will come before the court again next
month.

Copyright Law Thwarts Open Source Confab Demo
Posted by Dan Gillmor


Bruce Perens was going to demonstrate a modified DVD player at this week's
Open Source gathering in San Diego. He'd planned to show (Infoworld) how a
DVD player with its regional coding disabled could play DVDs with
different regional codes.

Perens was going to do this in violation, he believed, of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the circumvention of technological
methods to protect copyrighted material from uses the owner doesn't want.
And the possibility of legal trouble led his employer, Hewlett-Packard, to
ask him not to do the demonstration.

HP funds Perens to pursue a variety of free software projects. He was
willing to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried
that it would be ""a more juicy target,"" the kind of deep pockets that
might make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's
understandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would
take a stand on the right side of this issue.

So while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on
things like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration. A
shame, but that's how things are going these days.

Hollywood is winning, folks. You are losing. And you'd better start caring

I think we need to get away from rhetoric that implies that the

The ruling class, whether you define them as government or business

Yes, and the working class deserves what it gets, and possibly not even
that.  For the most part, people become wealthy by not being stupid.  I
always thought ""not being stupid (most of the time)"" was a fairly low
bar, but apparently most people can't even manage that.

That is really what it all boils down to:  There are lots of ignorant
and/or stupid people who are quite happy to stay that way, and it is a
key causal factor in why things are the way they are.  What are you

This isn't particularly well-founded logic.  What you're saying is 
that ""most rich people are smart"" and that the latter is causal to 
the former.  By implication, then, you would say that ""most poor 
people are stupid"".  This is true, statistically, because most 
people are poor and most people are also stupid.  However there's 
nothing to indicate a causal link there.  So being smart isn't the 
only mechanical requirement to eternal wealth because, obviously, 
most of the members of this list would be rich.

Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and 
respected, but he's not particularly rich.  Jennifer Lopez is by 
all accounts a complete moron.  In fact, spend a weekend in Beverly 
Hills and you will encounter vast numbers of people who are 
profoundly stupid driving Rolls Royces and shopping at PRADA.

The working class IS the market and the working class IS where 
wealth is created.  The working class makes long-distance calls, 
buys food processors and computers and clothes, and attaches the 
value to goods which allows them to be commodified.  The working 
class saves money, buys Retirement Savings Plans, and invests in 
mutual funds which increases the flow of capital through the 
investment funnel.

The economic system of the first world is designed to strike a 
delicate balance between incentivizing the ruling class to support 
wealth-expanding through technological innovation or the 
development of new markets.  At the 100,000 foot level, recessions 
and depressions are created when more wealth is sucked from the 
whirlpool than can be supported by the working class through 
investment and consumption.

And the people draining the hot tub are the folks in the ruling 
class -- people like Ken Lay, Dick Cheney, Bernie Ebbers, et al -- 
and they simply got too greedy and caused a bubble in the 
hydraulics that increased the pressure for a time, but ultimately 
wasn't sustainable.

And the money that was lost did not come from the ruling class.  It 
came from the RSP's and the Equity funds and the Investments of 
individual working class -- people who believed these reports and 
invested.  The wealth of the ruling class was largely pulled out by 
the time such investments were exposed to the workers.

So, is the lower caste necessarily stupid for saving money or 
investing in retirement plans?  I don't think so.  Are they stupid 
for buying clothes and automobiles?  I don't think so.

At the granular level, the notion that ""most rich people are rich 
because they're smart"" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not 
worth arguing about, so I won't.  Still, a compelling point worth 
some clarification.

At the grainular level it is simply that Those who can con enough folks
into giving up thier Choices to a governing body (usualy one they will

Power(over others)

bascialy  build the castle walls stronger to protect us from all enemys of
the  status quo both forgien and domestic.

I never said that rich people are smart, just less stupid than most
other people.  And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless
and stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter
don't stay poor for long, so it is a self-selecting population.  Hell, I
grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember
quite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly
wasn't because of The Man.  And my parents were poor because they made
lots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process. 
Unlike many others, I actually learned from the experience.

And I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense
and general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People
who earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't
manage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools.  It
isn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots
of bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making
lots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being
wealthy.

You are using a very narrow definition of ""smart"".  Smart doesn't make
you rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g.
Stephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote
their energy elsewhere than being ""rich"".  But I don't know too many
really smart people that actually choose to live in poverty.

It sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of
what wealthy people are like.  Hint: they are exactly like you and me,
but with a higher net worth.  In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds
of the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very
hard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are
completely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy).  ""Old wealth"" is
incredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three
generations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually
long-lived exceptions.

It's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort
into it.  However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and
expend a lot less energy.  Virtually all the people I know who are
wealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and
exaggerated amounts of drive.  Most people would not consider those
people's lives ""fun"", though those people tend to enjoy what they do.

Having not had a baby meself, but having listened to my mother and
countless others retell the tale, I'd reccomend to Adam a few bits of
advice:
1)  We don't generally have sex just to get preggers.   You'd never get
laid if that was the case. BUt hey, if we can convince you that the reason
women don't have sex with you adam is because they don't want to carry
your embittered, angry child, well hey.   Girls Win!
2)  Birth control.   Let me say this again because Adam has forgotten the
last 50 years (at least for the pill)  BIRTH control.
3)  For many women with men who can actually uh... satisfy, sex is great. 
 Maybe you're lacking in this department ? ;)

So moral of the story:   Women, keep telling Adam that no one will have
sex with him because they don't want to get preggers with his angry,
bitter children and go through the pain of childbirth.
yea.. thats it.

All children are different and will generally route around whatever

Yeah, I get that. I just think this is a poor
example. Corporate bankruptcy is a power fight
between creditors, management, and shareholders
over control of assets. Because a corporation is
incorporeal (hee, hee), it can't be much else.

If you're concerned about the imbalance of power
related to corporations, I think the more relevant
areas are tax structures, especially the income
tax, various forms of externality, law related to
employment, corporate transparency, and corporate
governance.

Yes, the current ones, but rarely if ever the original ones. Mom and pop

One scam to rule them all..,bitbitch@magnesium.net,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Tue, 30 Jul 2002 00:05:28 -0700","One scam to rule them all,
One scam to bind them, 
One scan to burn them all, 
And the stupidity bind them. 

(Yes, i'm ripping, and badly from LOTR) 

Alright, so NPR's All Things Considered had a wonderful story on the whole Nigerian 419 scams that seem to be running
into my inbox constantly (Thanks FoRK!) Turns out, these 419 scams (419 is the statute in Nigeria that this particular form
of fraud falls under) have actually snared a few people -- NPR reported to the tune of 100 million dollars over a few years, in the US alone.

One website listed the 419 scam as being the 'third to fith largest industry in Nigeria' (1), netting billions of dollars
from around the world.   Its large enough to warrant a governmental investigation and a special number to call and report
(to the secret service, no less) scam abuse. (2)   Folks are apparently being held for ransom if they decide to go
'check out' the scam.  (3).

Listen to the NPR article (4).   What's great about NPR is the commentary at the end. Turns out, this is all unbelievably
common.   The origination, at least to NPR's knowledge, starts with the scam elements being transposed from Nigeria,
to London, England.   Instead of the bereved widow of a Nigerian national, the originating con was directed to the 'heirs'
of Sir Frances Drake's estate.   If you were 'chosen' as an heir, you could contribute a portion of your money so that a
fellow heir (and scam artist) could reclaim the monetary largess in the Court of England, by proving that Elizabeth I had
nulled Sir Drake's will and taken his fortune as her own.   Oscar
Hartzell, the gent who started this scam, way back in the early 1800s,
managed to gain quite a fortune, all on the backs of idiots.   Sound familiar?

A fool and his money, deserve to be parted.

Coincidentally enough, I'm currently in the middle of a pretty good book 
about the Francis Drake scam called ""Drake's Fortune"" by Richard Raynor.

Despite being pretty familiar with the whole 419 scam stuff (see my earlier 
FoRK post from a few months back about how the whole scam works: 
http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2002-May/011928.html) I never put the 
two together as being related.

Apparently, I suck at pattern matching.

I don't know what poverty officially is,
but from a CA perspective, $15k income is
not going to go far.  At current interest
rates, one would probably want somewhere
around $500k* wealth to throw that amount,
which pretty much limits the non-working
class to a small, single-digit percentage
of households.  (how much overlap do we
have with the retirement cohort here?)

The 2000 numbers pretty much confirm it:
<http://ferret.bls.census.gov/macro/032001/hhinc/new06_000.htm>
shows that the top 5% of incomes are mostly
two+-earner households, and the zero-earner 
households are rare above median incomes.
We are the workers' paradise.

The census figured $18k as the cutoff for
lowest 5th, so with that as a poverty line,
the percentages break down as follows:

work\pov.  yes  no
yes        9    72
no        11     8

WASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound
researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act.

Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP
has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a
vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system.

In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a
loosely organized research collective, that it ""could be fined up to
$500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years"" for its role in
publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a
Tru64 Unix system.

HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been
invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now,
it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute
computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or
encrypted e-books.

If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the
company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer
security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code
that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that ""is
primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing
protection"" of copyrighted works.

On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to
SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a
computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator
privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias ""Phased,"" said in
the message: ""Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the
job.""

That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president
in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that
the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Boy, that is rather strange. I've always been under the impression that
the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's
long-standing ""10:00 A.M. policy"", in place until the decision in 1963 to
switch over to ""let-it-burn"".

The 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from
Europe, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a
policy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they
directly threatened property.

40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff
left to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement
forests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. 

I would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors
squarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes
upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of
materials, location, and landscaping.

If you'll look closely, I said the Forest Service official claimed it was 
the tree lovers lawsuits that prevented removal of trees by any means as at 
least partially responsible.  The lawsuits prevented the Forest Service 
from implementation of any project that involved tree removal.  These 
projects were designed to address the tree and undergrowth density that 
resulted from previous management policies.

In other words, Forest Service projects to clean up the mess resulting from 
their previous forest management practices are prevented by tree lover 
lawsuits.

Exactly, and tree lover lawsuits are preventing the removal of that 
stuff.  The result:  Fires like Cerro Grande.

There are very few replacement forests planted these days.  Those that are, 
are mostly planted on private land as commercial tree farms.

The primary desert warfare facilities and schools ARE in the Southwest,
most notably Fort Irwin deep in the Mojave/Anza Borrego (the
headquarters and core training facilities for all things desert warfare
related), and have been for a long time. There are two reasons that
immediately come to mind as to why they do not use the Fort Irwin,
Edwards AFB, and other expanses of desert that they have traditionally
used for desert warfare training and exercises.  

The first is logistical: Virtually all the mechanized infantry units are
located east of the Rockies, and it must be very expensive to move
entire heavy combat divisions a couple thousand miles every time they
want to run training exercises.  This is particularly true since so much
of our military is made up of reserve components these days, meaning
that you can't move the soldiers to where the training facilities are.

The second is environmental lawsuits and pending judicial action and
injunctions. The desert training facilities in the Southwest deserts
have been aggressively assaulted by environmental organizations who are
making the case that heavy mechanized units zipping back and forth
across the deep desert endanger the desert tortoise and a bunch of other
theoretically endangered species that are concentrated in the southwest
deserts. The ability of the military to use the desert facilities has
been significantly impeded these days while all the lawsuits and whatnot
with the various environmental groups are being sorted out.

No, not at all.  I was only concerned where the border between religion

How hot it feels is affected by both temperature and humidity.  In 
Mississippi they have lots of humidity, in the Southwest, we don't.

As I know from experience, Mississippi feels a lot hotter at 90 degrees F. 
than home (Santa Fe) does at 90.

Perhaps the military didn't want to train in a real desert because 1) it 
get's over 100 degrees and any time the air temp is greater than body temp 
it affects performance, and 2) when those troops go to a real desert 
they'll think it's so much nicer than Mississippi.

No, I'm not maligning Mississippi.  I had a great time passing through last

InfoSpace CEO to step down

BELLEVUE, Wash. AP) - InfoSpace Inc. chairman and chief executive Naveen 
Jain will step down from his posts once the Internet services and software 
company finds a replacement.

Jain, a former Microsoft executive, founded InfoSpace six years ago and led 
the company through its rise and fall. His departure from the top posts was 
announced Wednesday.

With its stock now trading for dimes, InfoSpace is in danger of being 
delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. The company is asking shareholders 
to approve a one-for-10 reverse stock split to prop up the price. If 
approved on Sept. 12, shareholders would trade in 10 shares of stock for 
one new share.

The company has had trouble retaining its top-level executives in the past, 
including most recently, former chief executive Arun Sarin who resigned 
last year after just nine months on the job.

The company said Jain will remain as a company employee.

Shares of InfoSpace fell 2 cents to 43 cents in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

W3C approves HTML 4 'emotitags' - Now you'll be able to say it with feeling,Damien Morton <damien.morton@acm.org>,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Fri, 02 Aug 2002 11:11:05 -0400","http://www.therockalltimes.co.uk/2002/04/08/new-tags.html

W3C approves HTML 4 'emotitags' - Now you'll be able to say it with
feeling
by Lester Haines

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a number of new html
'emotitags' which will revolutionise the web surfing experience.

The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional
response from the reader. Top of the list is <wot> (War on TerrorT). The
tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger
against ragheads, thus:

<wot>Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has
adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political
opponents.</wot>

Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new <iht> (I'm
hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of
Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:

<iht>She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her
instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly
missed.</iht>

The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and
self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset
about the death of a complete stranger.

Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new <spin> tag. Any
government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately
transparent:

<spin>Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling
him ""the most honest man it has been my privilege to know"".</spin>

And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified
the controversial <nolibel>. This guarantees any text contained within
it complete immunity from prosecution:

<nolibel>Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted
perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling
and obnoxious behaviour.</nolibel>

The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C
has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has
further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the
effect on the reader could be catastrophic:

<wot><iht><spin>In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen
victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme,
Stephen Byers noted: ""She was everybody's favourite grandmother who
touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from
this tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by
next Monday. And you can quote me on that.""</spin></iht></wot>

	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~gd216/set.pdf
or	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~gd216/set.ps

it uses a Shannon like entropy model for the anonymity provided by a
system uses this model to analyse the effect of different parameters
one can tune with mixmaster (POOLSIZE, RATE, in mixmaster.conf).

The ""anonymity entropy"" measurement can be interpreted as how many
bits of information the attacker needs to identify a user and is
computed from probabilities.

Would be interesting to try estimate the entropy provided by the
current mixmaster network.  A number of nodes publish their parameter
choices, and traffic volume over time (in hourly increments).

This is the way forward, IMO.  Just wait a couple of years until
66 million Muslim Turks are making great strides towards democracy
and prosperity in the E.U. and Syria, Lebanon etc start lining up and
making similar decisions.

Of course there are hard-liners who would be right at home on
Rumsfeld's staff, but they got out-voted:

Puts 127.0.0.1 as the IP for adservers. Elegant.

==

http://technoerotica.net/mylog/hostfile.html

As mentioned throughout this site, there is more than one way to skin a cat
when it comes to pop-ups. The hosts file is one of the most effective
methods there is. In brief, a hosts file is a text file used by Windows to
resolve domain names and IP addresses. If you're running windows, you
already have a hosts file but it most likely isn't being used.

What a hosts file does is simple, it lists domains and IP numbers. To get
rid of ads, the hosts file lists the domain names of adservers along with
the IP number 127.0.0.1. This tells windows to grab any content from the
listed domain from the specified IP number. The specified IP number in this
case is your own computer. What happens is that it won't display the ad. If
you choose this method of ad removal there is no need to use our opt out
links. The hosts file is a very effective mechanism.

You can download this hosts file, unzip it and place it in your Windows
directory. YOU SHOULD MAKE A BACK UP of your existing hosts file before you
do. The hosts file is called ""hosts"" there is no extension. You may have a
file named Hosts.sam this is merely a sample hosts file.

Once you download the file and put it in the windows folder, reboot your
computer and it's a done deal. Pretty simple huh? You might want to look at
the contents of this file as it contains additional information as well as
an address for getting updated versions. <http://www.accs-net.com/hosts/>

Because we're inherently lazy, this works for windows only, don't use it on
a mac! Follow the address in the hosts file for alternative system
instructions.
download now <http://technoerotica.net/mylog/hosts.zip>


We didn't write this file and do not provide support for it's use. Follow
the address in the hosts file for questions. It's not that we don't want to
hear from you but the folks at this address have the answers you need.

The mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all, much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures, much less present it to the public, and that the Bush administration appears to be against American-style justice.

The default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing.  The administration is here making the case that Americans don't even have a right to question government secrecy.

We may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11.

After Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil Liberty

August 4, 2002
By THE NEW YORK TIMES 




 

This article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil
A. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser. 

In the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John
Ashcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal
government and ""every available statute"" to hunt down and
punish ""the terrorists among us."" 

The roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with
wartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions
of more than 1,200 people suspected of violating
immigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or
fighting for the enemy. 

The government's effort has produced few if any law
enforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been
released or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held.


But it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being
waged in federal courthouses around the country, that
experts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance
between individual liberties and national security. 

The main combatants are the attorney general and federal
prosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders,
immigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil
libertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other,
with federal judges in between. 

The government's record has so far been decidedly mixed. As
it has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits,
the courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed
back, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft's
tactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them.
Federal judges have, however, allowed the government to
hold two American citizens without charges in military
brigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map
for how they might even challenge their detentions. 

In the nation's history, the greatest battles over the
reach of government power have occurred against the
backdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current
restrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by
historical standards and in light of the risks the nation
faces. 

The current struggle centers on three sets of issues.
People held simply for immigration violations have objected
to new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret,
and they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on
what they call unconstitutional preventive detentions. 

People brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those
thought to have information about terrorist plots, have
argued that they should not be held to give testimony in
grand jury investigations. 

Finally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two
Americans labeled ""enemy combatants"" for what the
government contends is more direct involvement with
terrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be
fundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer's
representation and a chance to challenge their detentions
before a civilian judge. 

So far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered
secret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny,
and on Friday a federal district judge in Washington
ordered that the identities of most of the detainees be
made public under the Freedom of Information Act. 

""Secret arrests,"" Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the
decision on Friday, ""are a concept odious to a democratic
society."" 

A senior Justice Department official said the detentions
had been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to
""prove a negative"" and cite specific terrorist acts that
had been disrupted. But he said that department officials
believed that the detentions had ""incapacitated and
disrupted some ongoing terrorist plans."" 

Two federal judges in New York have differed sharply on
whether the government may jail material witnesses while
they wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In
Virginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow
Mr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer. 

""I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer
them on, because they are doing exactly what an independent
judiciary should be doing,"" said Jane E. Kirtley, a
professor at the University of Minnesota and former
executive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press. ""It's not hostile or adversarial; it's simply
skeptical."" 

These lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet
been tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that
appeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more
sympathetic to the government's tactics and arguments. 

The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance,
reversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a
lawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider
additional evidence and arguments. 

But even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the
government's sweeping argument that the courts have no role
in reviewing the government's designation of an American
citizen as an enemy combatant. 

The detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of
the Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were
cabdrivers, construction workers or other types of
laborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before
being cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released. 

Last month, at a conference held by a federal appeals
court, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the
Clinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant
attorney general under President Bush, saying that the
administration's refusal to identify the people it had
detained reminded him of the ""disappeareds"" in Argentina. 

""I'll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the
mothers marching in the streets asking for the names of
those being held by the government,"" Mr. Christopher said.
""We must be very careful in this country about taking
people into custody without revealing their names."" 

Mr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from
Vietnam, recalled his family's anguish when his father was
taken away in 1975 for ""re-education."" In contrast, he
said, those detained by the United States were not being
secretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek
lawyers. 

""These are not incognito detentions,"" he said. ""The only
thing we will not do is provide a road map for the
investigations."" 

According to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than
1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on
immigration charges. Officials said recently that 81
remained in detention. Court papers indicate there were
about two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other
detainees were held on various state and federal criminal
charges. 

President Bush also has announced plans to try suspected
foreign terrorists before military tribunals, though no
such charges have been brought yet. 

Last month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding
in Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a
British citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his
shoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very
establishment of those tribunals ""has the effect of
diminishing the American jury, once the central feature of
American justice."" 

Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan,
added: ""This is the most profound shift in our legal
institutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all -
it has taken place without engaging any broad public
interest whatsoever."" 

Jack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the
University of Chicago Law School, have written that the
Bush administration's policies are a minimal challenge to
civil liberties especially compared with changes during the
times of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What
has changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil
liberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government. 

The Secrecy 

U.S. Says Hearings 
Are Not Trials 

Ten days
after last September's attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the
nation's chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping
instructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out
to be more than 600 ""special interest"" immigration cases. 

""Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all
other cases on the docket,"" Judge Creppy wrote. ""The
courtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no
family, and no press."" 

""This restriction,"" he continued, ""includes confirming or
denying whether such a case is on the docket."" 

The government has never formally explained how it decided
which visa violators would be singled out for this
extraordinary process, and it has insisted that the
designations could not be reviewed by the courts. 

But as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and
Muslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for
example at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious
neighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that
only a few of these detainees had any significant
information about possible terrorists. 

As the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of
legal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking
legal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have
ordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable
skepticism about the government's justifications for its
detention policies generally. 

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the
hardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on
violations that in the past would not have resulted in
incarceration. 

""Preventive detention,"" he said, ""is such a radical
departure from constitutional traditions that we certainly
shouldn't be undertaking it solely on the Justice
Department's say-so."" 

Malek Zeidan's detention would have been unexceptional had
it not given rise to one of the legal challenges that
threatens to end the secret proceedings. 

Mr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa
14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than
a decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven
an ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and
Naturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him
about a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr.
Zeidan was working at Dunkin' Donuts, and his expired visa
soon cost him 40 days in custody. 

When a hearing was finally held three weeks after his
detention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr.
Zeidan's cousin and reporters. 

The closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal
court, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers.
In March, the government dropped the ""special interest""
designation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond,
and the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration
charges against him will be considered in the fall. 

""You're one of the lucky ones,"" his lawyer, Regis
Fernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other
visa violators were held as long as six or seven months
before being deported or released. 

Mr. Zeidan's lawyers believe that their legal strategy,
which focused on openness, forced the government's hand. 

""The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt,"" Mr.
Fernandez said. ""We figured if the public had access to
these hearings they would see that nothing went on except
multiple adjournments and delay."" 

Through a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An
I.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be
named, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan's
case and in similar cases. 

He said the immigration service had always detained people
without bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He
added that the agency had no choice now but to detain a
visa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was
sure the person was not involved in terrorism. 

""Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days
and then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he
was a terrorist,"" the official said. 

The newspapers' lawsuit has continued. It has already once
reached the Supreme Court, and the government's papers
contain one of the fullest accounts of its position on
secrecy and executive power. 

Its main argument is that the courts have no role because
immigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely
administrative hearings that can be closed at will. 

Bennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he
was flabbergasted by this suggestion. 

""A trial is a trial,"" he said. ""A person's liberty is at
stake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being
told where to live."" 

But in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases,
Dale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for
counterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I.,
outlined the reasoning behind the government demand for
total secrecy. 

""Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous
in isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist
groups,"" he said. 

This rationale for withholding information, sometimes
called the mosaic theory, is controversial. 

""It's impossible to refute,"" Professor Kirtley said,
""because who can say with certainty that it's not true?"" 

In May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal
district court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan,
ruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation
hearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is
able to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case
basis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the
month before, though that case involved only a single
detainee. 

The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge
Bissell's order until the appeal was decided. The court,
which will hear arguments in September, declined to do
that. A number of news organizations, including The New
York Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in
support of the newspapers. 

The government then asked the United States Supreme Court
to stay Judge Bissell's order. The court, in a relatively
unusual move given that the case was not before it for any
other purpose, blocked Judge Bissell's order, suggesting
that it might have more sympathy for the government's
arguments. 

The Witnesses 

Rights Violated, 
Lawyers Contend 

Late on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled
two nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul
Mohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They
were carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000
in cash and had also shaved their body hair. 

The agents' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used
box cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and
had received letters instructing them to ""shave excess hair
from the body."" An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said
there was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian
men were involved in, or ""were associated"" with, those
responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. 

But even though government officials told reporters that
the men had been detained as material witnesses, their
lawyers now say that they were held last fall only on
immigration violations. 

The distinction is important because a material witness
warrant brings the automatic appointment of a
government-paid lawyer, while the government does not have
to supply a visa violator with counsel. 

As a result, the authorities were able to question each of
the men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer
present, their current lawyers say. 

Like some of the people who were picked up as material
witnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails
in New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr.
Azmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did,
their lawyers say. 

""It's wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never
bring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,""
Mr. Shah's lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an
interview. ""It's wrong not to provide him with an attorney
at the threshold. It's wrong to depict this as an I.N.S.
investigation, when in truth and in fact, it's the main
inquiry into the World Trade Center debacle."" 

Anthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his
client was interrogated ""often times for several hours a
day, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire
questions from three or four different people."" 

Eventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men
of any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in
June in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting
sentencing. 

Federal prosecutors said in court papers that both men
consented to questioning. Each ""was read and waived his
Miranda rights before each interview,"" prosecutors wrote,
adding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses.


The United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey,
would not comment on the specific cases, but said generally
of the government's tactics: ""I don't see any violation of
any rule, regulation, or law. 

""I can understand defense lawyers not being happy,"" he
said. ""But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every
available tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole
field and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole
field. 

""We need to do whatever we can that's legal to investigate
and disrupt,"" he added. 

Today, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen
material witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being
detained. 

But the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred
intense criticism. 

Last April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District
Court in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law ""to detain
people who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in
order to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of
the statute."" 

Judge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when
witnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for
grand jury investigations. ""Since 1789,"" Judge Scheindlin
said, ""no Congress has granted the government the authority
to imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that
he will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal
investigation."" 

Then last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of
Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the
government's use of the material witness statute in grand
jury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin's
reasoning. 

Judge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief
Justice John Marshall that ""the public has a right to every
man's evidence,"" held that detentions of material witnesses
during investigations are proper. 

The War Captives 

No Lawyers Allowed 
Under U.S. Label 

Yasser Esam Hamdi, a
Saudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably
an American citizen by virtue of having been born in
Louisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind
of role the nation's courts should have, if any, in
reviewing the government's imprisonment of someone charged
with something akin to a war crime. 

Prosecutors will be back in Federal District Court in
Norfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal
judges who has shown resistance to the government's
approach that once someone is declared an ""enemy combatant""
by the president, all judicial review ceases. 

Judge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan,
has twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and
ordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal
public defender, to be allowed to visit him without
government officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar
said that ""fair play and fundamental justice"" require it.
He said the government ""could not cite one case where a
prisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United
States District Court, who was held incommunicado and
indefinitely."" 

But the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge
Doumar's order, saying he had not fully considered the
government's needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and,
more important, the executive branch's primacy in areas of
foreign and military affairs. 

""The authority to capture those who take up arms against
America belongs to the commander in chief,"" Chief Judge J.
Harvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel. 

But even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at
the breadth of what the government was asserting when he
asked the Justice Department's lawyer, ""You are saying that
the judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone's
stature as an enemy combatant?"" 

The government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide
the court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by
which they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant.
But the government has argued that judges cannot argue with
the standards. 

Judge Doumar has indicated that he will question the
government closely on those standards. 

The case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far
as that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge
to normal judicial procedures. 

Mr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like
Mr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig
after having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike
Mr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield
by the military but on United States soil by civil law
enforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago. 

After his detention as a material witness based on
suspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and
information to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred
to military custody. 

""This is the model we all fear or should fear,"" said Mr.
Dunham, the public defender. ""The executive branch can
arrest an American citizen here and then declare him an
enemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the
courts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him
or giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any
evidence.""

Internet Defamation Suit Ends With Defense Verdict

http://www.law.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/View&c=LawArticle&cid=1028320303259&t=LawArticleTech

John Council
Texas Lawyer 08-05-2002



In one of the first trials in the country to
address Internet defamation, a Dallas County,
Texas, jury last week rejected a $700 million
suit by an Internet company that claimed it
was harmed by negative electronic messages
posted by an employee of a competing company.

ZixIt, a Dallas Internet company, filed ZixIt
Corp. v. Visa International, et al. in 1999,
alleging it was harmed by Paul Guthrie, then
a vice president with Visa. ZixIt alleged in
its suit that Guthrie posted more than 400
anonymous messages, many of them negative,
about ZixIt on the Yahoo Finance ZixIt Internet
message board, causing ZixIt's stock price to
drop.

The suit also alleged that the postings
destroyed the company's ability to market
its ZixCharge Internet transaction
authorization system, which allows consumers
to make purchases without revealing their
credit card numbers to merchants. Visa has
a similar Internet payment system.

ZixIt alleged that the postings caused its
stock price to plummet. Had the product
been successful, the company believed it
would have been worth more than $1 billion,
according to lawyers involved in the case.

On July 31, a jury in Judge Merrill Hartman's
192nd District Court found that ZixIt's
product was not harmed by the postings.

Neal Manne and Kenneth McNeil, lawyers from
Houston's Susman Godfrey who represented
ZixIt at trial, did not return calls for
comment by press time.

""The company hasn't made any decision about
an appeal,"" says Cindy Lawrence, a ZixIt
spokeswoman. ""The outcome of the lawsuit
doesn't have any effect on our future
products and services in e-messaging.""

GETTING GRADED

Visa's lawyers alleged that Guthrie acted on
his own and had a right to free speech, and
that Guthrie's Internet postings had no
effect on ZixIt's stock. Guthrie has since
left Visa, lawyers for the company say.
Guthrie was not a defendant in the case.
However, his interests in the case were
represented by Todd Noonan, an attorney in
Sacramento, Calif.'s Stevens & O'Connell.
Noonan was recovering from surgery last
week and was unavailable for comment.

""I think people believe whether you
succeed or fail [is] because of what you
do and not what other people do to you.
Internet companies didn't succeed for all
sorts of reasons,"" says Jeff Tillotson, a
partner in Dallas' Lynn, Tillotson & Pinker,
who defended Visa at trial.

ZixIt's case was a hard sell to the jury,
especially with the reality of the economy,
Tillotson says.

""Everyone knows that the stock market
has fallen and the trouble with Internet
companies. I think the jury took that into
account,"" Tillotson says.

There were lessons to be learned from the
Internet defamation trial, says Mike Lynn,
who also represented Visa at trial. Even
though message boards are considered a
protected form of free speech, that freedom
won't prevent a company from being dragged
into court if its employee blasts another
company on the Internet, Lynn says.

""A company can be responsible for what an
employee posts on a message board,"" Lynn
says. ""The courts have said you're entitled
to go to a jury to determine whether there
are damages as a result of that. The law is
very odd, not mature, [and] damage theories
are not mature.""

The nature of the case also added an
interesting twist to the trial, Tillotson
says. Many of those who posted messages on
the board attended the trial and posted
comments about the daily proceedings
throughout the three-week trial, he says.

""It was apparent to everyone that many of
the people who posted on these message boards
were watching the trial,"" Tillotson says.
""It really was wild. The lawyers felt like
they were being graded.""

The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14),UW Email Robot <pine-robot@docserver.cac.washington.edu>,fork <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>,"Tue, 06 Aug 2002 20:49:59 -0700","--------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is MIME?

MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the
standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending
images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. 

How can I read a MIME message?

Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)

In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
still hope! 

There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed
at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 

Does MIME replace UUENCODE?

Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the
message transformations made by certain email gateways. 

How can I learn more about MIME?

The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: 
                                                       
     o  US East Coast                            
        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        
                                                        
     o  US West Coast                            
        Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)      
                                                        
     o  Pacific Rim

>Mail Me the Money!
>By David Friedman 08/08/2002

David is a very bright fellow. But this time he's
several years behind. The idea of using epostage
to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The
problem is how to get over the adoption hump.
Until most people are taking one form of epostage,
most people don't have enough incentive to download
and install something that allows them to pay it.
Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of
epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown
senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even
from known senders. Giving someone my email address
doesn't automatically put them in my white list.

Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by
removing the need to pay money for epostage.
Instead, the sender burns processing time on his
computer, answering a cryptographically hard
challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is
inadequate incentive to do so until there is a
standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is
born until a significant fraction of the market
has taken that first step. It may take government
action, to institute an effective epostage
standard!

I think the better idea is to require that people
off your white list ""hand sign"" email to you. A
couple of companies are now trying to implement
this. An email sender, if not on your white list,
must respond to a verification email or go to a
website, by a process that is very simply for a
human sender, but difficult for a spammer to
automate. Where epostage requires a standard
mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for ""hand
signing"" would frustrate spammers while making it
no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm
hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail
clients incorporate this kind of feature. The
advantage to putting this in the mail client is
that the required ""hand sign"" can be personalized:

  ""Your attempt to email David Friedman is
  blocked until you fill in the blank: The
  Incredible ______ Machine.""

It will be a long time before spammers have a
process that defeats millions of personal
challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in
mind that would work a large percentage of the
time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure
out such hacks, people would then improve their
challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another
arms race, and spam would leak through to the
unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps
spammers identify and target the part of the
population whose challenges are sub-par, which
is their natural prey. People like David aren't
in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley
debt consolidation.

Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he
didn't point out that spam is the result of
government. The government is ineffective at
preventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals
and ISPs from taking retribution against spammers.

I don't think there is a specific word in English for eye goop. 
However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is
a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it:
muta, pronounced ""MOO-ta"".  Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I
automatically use that word for ""eye goop"" when speaking English (how
often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a
linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into
my vocabulary.

Not that this is important, but I've inadvertently adopted ""muta"" into
my version of the English language as the word for ""eye goop"".  Arguably
better than ""smegma"" anyway.

This only restates the assertion, it doesn't clarify /how/ government
restrains you, other than under laws of criminal conduct and violent
crimes (if you meant the above literally)

If I can trace a spammer to their ISP, I can /generally/ get that
account revoked, and if you trace one to their parent corporation, I
don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits,
it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way.  If you
have some law that prevents action against spammers, then why all the
class-action suits and other anti-spam court cases, some even
state-funded?

I'm also curious of the mechanics of your retribution strategy: Let's
say you did win a lawsuit and shut down the largest spammer network in
the USA, do you really believe 40 Beijing spammers won't fill the
void?  Do you really believe those 40 are not right now prepping their
mail servers whether or not you prevail over your countrymen? How do
you intend to take legal (and/or violent) action against people a
world away and in a culture you can barely understand let alone
understand how to properly bribe?  

I'm not so hopeful this method can work against aromatherapy viagra
when we can't even track and convict murderous Nigerian mafia, and
they are blatant!  Political solution is a contradiction in terms, and
it's also true that no lawmaker has ever been even a tenth the
catalyst on improving the quality of life in Britain and the western
world as did central heating and the invention of one A.J.Crapper.

Spammers fall into two categories. The more
difficult case are those whose back-end business
can be executed entirely in a foreign nation, such
as the 419 spammers. And you're right: there's not
much we can do about those, except filter them in
various ways. But the vast majority of spammers
have a back-end business that requires a native
presence. Debt consolidation. Mortgages. Herbalife
and other MLMs. Even porn sites require credit
card transactions. That means the people responsible
CAN be found.

>I don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits, 
>it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way.

There have been some successful suits, but (a) it
takes too much effort, and (b) the result isn't enough
to deter the spammer. But you're talking about action
constrained by law. In an anarchy, people act more
directly, with less cost, and to more effect. Spammers
very quickly would learn their lesson. Except for the
ones who ply their scam in a foreign country.

Of course, that's assuming there are ISPs and other
infrastructure in an anarchy. Arguing about how things
would work without the state involves a large degree

Hmm. I've lived most of my life in houses that did
not have central heating, including my current abode.
As to the crapper, it did not do nearly as much to
improve waste management in cities as did the public
sewers which it feeds, and the water lines that supply
it. Without these, you would find that a chamber pot
works just as well.

Of course. What we need is an anonymous betting pool on prominent

Uh, account revokation doesn't have quite the same level of deterrence as

There are several issues here.

(1) For reasons that have nothing to do with
commercial advertising, we need email software that
prevents virus attacks a la Melissa and Klez. We
simply can't continue down the path where every
script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can
cause millions or billions of dollars worth of
damage.

(2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the
point that digital signatures are the standard way
to recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging
your machine or otherwise compromising your private
key will be the only way that someone can forge a
message from you. I don't see any reason that email
software that automatically uses digital signatures
for contact management and whitelisting would be
any more expensive than existing email clients.
Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly
on it.

(3) I think identity theft should be made a felony,
with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have
nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply
parading around with a sign that says ""I'm George
Bush"" is not identity theft. On the other hand,
I think using a virus to compromise someone else's
private key should should fall into that category.

If you crypto-sign your outgoing mail, you don't have to set 
your mailwall whitelist to accept unsigned mail spoofed as being 
from you. 

Similarly, if you include some weaker token or checksum that
spammers can't easily guess. 

If you can track the actual sender, then the proof that they've
committed identity fraud is your credible testimony that you
are the rightful user of the declared originating address, and
that you did not send the message. I'm not sure what level of
damages you could claim, though.

You seem to be saying that whitelists are useless, because there are worms
which can compromise your system, read your address book/whitelist, and
sent themselves on, compromising a nonnegligible fraction of systems as
they go along. 

While mailing lists can be spam/worm amplifiers, I don't think this is
true for individual users even today. Moreover, worms which use email as
vector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken
default settings, and insists to make documents executables. This makes
for very bad press, and eventually that vendor is going to wise up, and 
stop shipping as many broken wares (or people will switch to more secure 
alternatives, whatever comes first).

If you're using the mail client on your personal

a passphrase, unless that is part of how you secure

The original comment's context was digital signatures. A digital signature
is worth sqrat if any userspace app or rogue superuser code can grab your
keyring in clear, and send out stuff in your name. A passphrase unlocking
the keyring for that particular use is a minimal protection (since not
immune to passphrase snarfers), but this is much, much better than always
leaving your key in the lock. (Why then having at all the key, in the
first place?)

A passphrase is a (long, secure) password unlocking (decrypting) your 
keyring. You don't use a passphrase to read your email. Unless it resides 
on a crypto file system.

If you have a rogue app on your machine, what

one of the reasons I keep harping on the need for

When I read email, I want to respond to email,

that it needs to be at the ready.

Subject: [camram-spam] another framework hashcash related framework

There is a framework for using a hashcash like proof of work function
as a way to frustrate junk mailers in this paper:

""Curbing Junk E-Mail via Secure Classification""

by E. Gabber, M. Jakobsson, Y. Matias, A. Mayer Bell

in FC98.

Online copy here:

http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/27735.html

(Look in the view or download section at the top right, it's
availabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats).

The framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the
current camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white
list.  They use target revokable email addresses (basically identical
to the LWPA concept) to implement the white list.

The resulting framework is essentially identical to what I proposed in
recent message with:

Subject: target revokable email addresses, and postage-free tokens

Their idea of including the postage free-token in the email address,
mirrors what is done in LWPA and makes the system exhibit smoother
migration for non-users.  eg. you can use varied sender addresses and
it will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else
and it will still work etc.

They have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for
installing some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- ""gatekeeper""
they call it.

Clearly you've never met ""Triumph"", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing
Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the
story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who
was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary
""discovered"" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car
a few years back.

I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
gonna be pretty.


Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple
of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed
Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.


Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their
activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too
much in the way of ""escaped"" ""revenue"", or at least the perception of
same in the local ""free"" press. Obviously, if your money ""there""
isn't exchangeable into your money ""here"", it kind of defeats the
purpose of keeping your money ""there"" in the first place, giving
folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line
credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or
quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and
the US.

As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom
on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually
accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
pretexts.

At this point, the ""legal"", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings
are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep
my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where
a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will
close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned
statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or
imagined property rights are this afternoon.


The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only
solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private
transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than ""transparent""
transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*
interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal
freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and
groom action figures sold separately, of course.

Cheers,
RAH
(Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.
Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and
I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better
in Anguilla, and the ""private"" banking system there is probably just
as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and
move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar
Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and
Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in
ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe
we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and

As long as the OS doesn't give you a convenient GetPassPhrase() method 
that threat model is theoretical. Worms are autonomous, and autonomous

Dunno.. Some of the new Sonys (I'm hunting again for a lappy, as the
Toshiba I have is a large piece of cow manure)  which promise a 4 hour
battery life off of ONE battery are pretty damn impressive.  As far as
the keyboard issue, the Toshiba actually came out with a good
keyboard, nearly equivalent to most standard keyboards (Not ergonomic,
alas, but I have a USB happy ergo keyboard I can always plug in if I
get restless).   I can't imagine surviving at Law school without a
lappy, but thats just me.

then again, I don't know what you do with your laptops, Gene :)

Not really. If code can sign stuff without me being aware of it that
pretty much invalidates the (already tenuous, since it assumes me trusting
the contents of the frame buffer) concept of a digital signature.

A secure piece of hardware puts the keyring outside of any code's reach.  
The key never leaves the hardware compartment. I have to mechanically
acknowledge a signing process. The cryto fob then falls back to the
default state: locked.

I'm pretty comfortable with entering my passphrase every time. This is not 
production key, as I usually access my home box via a SSH session, and SSH 
sessions are easily attackable with a model of your typing pattern. So 
don't expect me to announce my plutonium shipments via this medium.

I agree. Nevertheless, a number of people who use cryptography have their 
machines compromised.

Bad assumption.

A reasonable UI would have me enter my passphrase *at most* each 
time I launch my mail program -- never more than once per day,
sometimes once per week. 

For some of myy workstations, I'd even be happy with the necessary
signing key being cached on disk, so signing is automatic when I
hit 'send'.

If spammer code can read my local hard disk, I have bigger problems
than spoofed spam.

Yup, I've been meaning to cobble together procmail + script for this, as 
a few Google searches didn't turn up anything. Did anyone here get there 
first?

(I guess I want a config file of mailboxes who normally sign their mail, 
and procmail that runs gpg and adds headers...)

FWIW, the 'Enigmail' add-on for Mozilla's mail client has it happily 
talking to GPG (and I believe PGP). You can choose how long it remembers 
your passphrase for, default is 15 mins.

see http://enigmail.mozdev.org/

This feature was enough to get my off my Pine habit, since (to answer 
the original question) the combination of SpamAssassin and shared 
whitelists means that forged 'From:' headers are pretty much the only 
spam I see in my inbox now.

The Fingerworks dvorty ergo keyboards are pretty good for that; unfold, plug
the USB port and go, but you don't get the angle unless you put the castiron
(sort of) bracket (and optional gel palm-rests) in your pack.  Big airport fun there.
The flexi-PCB connecting the halves is probably only good for 100,000 flexes too.

Kind of useless for keysigning though; is it not law that when you have to sign,

Lots of the tabletPCs have daylight readable FLCDs.  (From looking

Tablet OS though.)   An item from their handy pres. below.


So after looking at Transmetazone, tell me where (also) stateside I'm

The Sony U series is all Crusoe, but then TigerDirect will be all grins
to sell you a lappad that gets you to 10h on a P4m...maybe a P4, who's to

I often use just such a posting to send emails to lists but also to

Where my spam filter draws the line is for emails which /only/ have

As a practical matter, I doubt the value sold in such situations ever
adds up to the value lost.  And the non-pecuiary since of violation,
loss, and trouble has to get in there somewhere if we are really picky.

I don't think considering marginal utility of dollars has value in this
situation.  We aren't debating whether the thief is better off -- he is.

I'm not a lawyer either.  I played one on TV once but I didn't play a
very good one and they canceled it after the first episode ...

The situtation I described came from my recollection of Epstein's
'Takings'.  He was specifically rejecting the idea of absolute property
right found in Liberation theology and was using the idea -- that in an
emergency where my life depends upon it I'm entitled to violate your

Maybe I did get it all wrong, but that particular recollection is
relatively strong precisely because it gave a good reason why my

not be the statuatory law in a particular jurisdiction.

NYTimes.com Article: Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on Retailers,khare@alumni.caltech.edu,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Mon, 12 Aug 2002 23:09:04 -0400","This article from NYTimes.com

Let's see... a decimal digit is about 3.33 bits, so this is all about moving from a 36-bit to a 46-bit addressing system. Kind of makes the debate about IPv6 spaces quite real, as well as the Auto-ID center at MIT's proposal for a physical markup language. 

Actual barcode size may yet decline to the point that 2-D codes may yet make it an individual-item level of addressing.

Seeing software systems this fantastically brittle after fifty years is not, unfortunately, surprising. Are we sure we really know better yet? Are angle brackets really the key to immortality? :->

Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on Retailers

August 12, 2002
By KATE MURPHY 




 

In a little more than two years, retailers in the United
States and Canada will face a deadline that promises
technological challenges akin to the Year 2000 computer
problem. 

Starting Jan. 1, 2005, the 12-digit bar codes retailers use
to identify everything from cars to candy bars will go to
13 digits. The additional number (and associated bars and
spaces) is enough to make checkout scanners seize up and
make computers crash, perhaps disrupting entire supply
chains. 

But many retailers have yet to focus on a problem that will
require significant investments in time and capital. 

""Most retailers are public companies that tend to live
quarterly and not look ahead, which means they are going to
be hit over the head with this and have to scramble at the
last minute to avert disaster,"" said Thomas Friedman,
president of Retail Systems Research Services, a company in
Newton, Mass., that publishes a retail information
technology newsletter. 

Leading retailers say they have begun to address the issue.
A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest
retailer, said the company had ""embraced the concept"" of an
expanded bar code, but he did not respond to questions
about actual measures taken to prepare computer databases
and logistical systems. Similarly, a spokesman for the
Target Corporation said his company was ""intellectually
ready"" for the change but refused to comment on whether any
of its stores or warehouses were technologically ready. 

But Richard A. Galanti, the chief financial officer of
Costco Wholesale, admitted, ""The truth is, given the
timeline, everybody's still in the assessment phase, trying
to figure out what to do."" 

The difficulty is similar to the one posed by the Year 2000
computer problem, when computer software had to be switched
from two-digit entries identifying years to four-digit
entries. Before Jan. 1, 2000, millions of lines of code had
to be rewritten to avoid widespread computer failures. 

Bar codes have been used in packaging since 1974, when the
first item, a pack of chewing gum, was scanned at a
supermarket in Ohio. The codes identify a product,
distinguishing between an eight-ounce can of Del Monte
creamed corn and a medium-size pair of Hanes boxer shorts.
When a bar code is scanned, the information in the store's
database lets the retailer assign a price and track sales
and inventory. 

""The bar code is the linchpin upon which everything in
retail depends,"" Mr. Friedman said. 

The reason for expanding the 12-digit bar code, known as
the Universal Product Code, is twofold. First, there is a
shortage of U.P.C. numbers. ""There's only a certain amount
of 12-digit numbers, and we're going to run out,"" said John
Terwilliger, vice president of global markets at the
Universal Code Council, a nonprofit organization based in
Lawrenceville, N.J., that assigns codes in the United
States and Canada. Second, 13-digit bar codes are used
almost everywhere else in the world. The council's European
counterpart, EAN International, based in Brussels, assigns
these numbers, called European Article Numbers, to
companies in 99 nations. ""Right now,"" Mr. Terwilliger said,
""foreign importers have to get a 12-digit U.P.C. to do
business over here, which they haven't been too happy
about."" 

Foreign manufacturers currently pass on to consumers the
cost of getting an additional bar code and creating special
labels for products sold in the United States and Canada.
""It's an added expense for them, and they have to recoup it
somewhere,"" said Debra Shimkus, marketing manager at the
Chicago Importing Company, a specialty food importer whose
overseas suppliers are often incredulous when they are told
they have to get new bar codes for their products before
they can be sold in American groceries. 

Many foreign manufacturers decide that it is not worth the
trouble. ""A lot of companies have been unwilling to accept
the additional burden,"" Mr. Terwilliger said, ""and have
stayed out of the market entirely."" 

American and Canadian exporters have not had the same
obstacle because foreign retailers can easily incorporate a
12-digit number into their 13-digit databases by making the
first digit zero. That is why American and Canadian
manufacturers of products that now have 12-digit codes will
not be affected by the code expansion. A two-liter bottle
of Coca-Cola, for example, will keep the same U.P.C., but a
zero will be added to the beginning of its bar-code number
in retailers' product databases. 

""The effect of the change in the U.P.C. code falls squarely
on retailers,"" said Mr. Friedman. He estimates that the
upgrade will cost at least $2 million for a chain of 100
stores with 10 checkout lanes a store. 

The expense will vary depending on the age of a retailer's
databases, software and hardware and whether it has to hire
outside consultants to make the change. Scanners and other
hardware bought more than three years ago will not read
longer codes and will have to be replaced. Software more
than five years old will also have to be scrapped. 

""Thank God we'd already planned to buy new equipment for a
lot of stores this year,"" said Richard S. Gilbert, director
of store systems at Duane Reade, a chain of 200 drugstores
in New York City. The stores have a total of 3,500 scanning
devices, each costing $1,000 to $2,500. As for the
cumbersome database modifications that need to be made, Mr.
Gilbert said: ""Our consultants say they are working on it,
but they haven't gotten back to me with a plan. I still
don't know how big a deal it's all going to be."" 

He might want to ask John Poss. Mr. Poss is the
merchandising coordinator for Ace Hardware, which has 5,100
stores and sells some 65,000 coded products. Ace overhauled
its computer systems to accept longer bar codes in 1999.
The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., has retail outlets
in 70 countries and more than a hundred foreign suppliers. 

""It was such a struggle to get manufacturers to relabel
things for North America,"" Mr. Poss said, ""and we wanted
the same system in place globally, so we decided to make
the change."" 

The company hired a consultant, Cognizant Technology
Solutions, which is based in Teaneck, N.J., and is a
division of Dun & Bradstreet. Ace's in-house team worked on
the project during the day while a Cognizant office in
India took over at night. 

Even so, the project took almost two years to plan and
carry out. In addition to equipment upgrades, modifications
had to be made in more than 500 software programs in
various company divisions (50 in distribution alone). The
most tedious and time-consuming part of the conversion, Mr.
Poss said, was making adjustments to databases. ""Every
database in every division touches bar code information,
and they all needed to be reworked,"" he said. ""It's like
Y2K, where you had to go in and expand fields and find
every reference to the date."" 

Though Mr. Poss would not disclose the cost of the project,
he said the gains in efficiency and in suppliers' good will
had been ""well worth the expense."" His advice to other
retailers is to ""get busy because you're facing an extreme
challenge."" 

But moving to 13 digits may not be enough. The Universal
Code Council and EAN International, which formed an
alliance in 1996, strongly advise manufacturers and
retailers to go a step further and prepare their systems to
accommodate a 14-digit code. That is the length of a newly
patented bar code that takes up less space. Its reduced
size means that it can be affixed to small items like loose
produce, and the extra digits let a retailer keep track of
additional data like batch and lot numbers. 

That additional information would make product recalls
easier. ""Today,"" Mr. Terwilliger said, ""once a product is
taken out of the shipping container in the warehouse, you
really can't track it anymore."" 

Shipping container bar codes are already 14 digits. The
different bar-code standards mean that retailers need
different computer systems for shipping and receiving,
inventory and sales. By adopting a 14-digit standard,
retailers should be able to put all the information into a
single database. 

Mr. Poss said Ace had added the capacity to scan and store
14 digits when it made its conversion three years ago. ""Now
we can scan anything,"" he said, ""whether it's in the
warehouse or at the register, and it immediately goes in to
a centralized system. No more sending data between
divisions."" 

The cost and work of making the transition to 14 digits, he
said, was the same as it would have been for a change to 13
digits. 

Representatives from the standards groups said adopting a
14-digit structure - a step for which no date has been set
- could help streamline the sharing of data among all parts
of a retail operation. It would also make it possible, they
said, to identify products anywhere in the world at any
time during the trade process. 

""And to think it all started with pack of gum,"" Mr. Poss
said.

I can't imagine why they're inching forward through 
13- and then 14- digit extensions; seems they should
just leap ahead to something with real headroom, say
40-digit numbers (128 bits or more). 

How hard can it be to widen the glyph area and 
narrow the bars? The sensors have got to be tens
or even hundreds of times more accurate/robust 
than when barcodes first took off.

One segment of the article along these lines:

A newly *patented* bar code, that merely fits 14 digits
into less space? I sure hope there's more to this
""invention"" than ""more lines, and narrower"". 

They might as well go 2-D to fit in lots of extra bits,
which could also ease the transition to the capacity 
radio-transponder tags may offer.

A bunch of info on different barcode standards, including
2-D variants, with examples is at:

That might work easily enough for reasonably rigid
solids that can be positioned and fingerprinted. I
think it would be more difficult for other items.
Like a sweater. The exact pattern of threads is never
quite the same, with the loose weave and all. The
problem of automatically capturing any object's look,
adequately to uniquely identifying it later, is still
open research.

TCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the Masses,Seth Johnson <seth.johnson@RealMeasures.dyndns.org>,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 14 Aug 2002 04:31:22 -0400","
TCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the Masses

While security experts poke and jab at what bits and pieces
of the TCPA and Palladium specs they can get ahold of, they
have tended to focus on how they work and what they imply as
far as concerns such as privacy and security go, or
alternatively, in terms of how they would impact the
functionality of the general purpose logic device.  Analysts
both favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from
these standpoints, while paying much less attention to what
the proposals imply from the standpoint of what content
control itself really means.

The most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not
whether they may interfere with the power of the universal
logic device, or whether they are effectual from the
standpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these
are all very important concerns.  Rather, the fundamental
problem they present is in the political premises that they
hope to implement for the sake of the ""content industries.""

TCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the
concepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May
20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course).  The
WPPT declares an unprecedented ""moral right"" of authors to
control public uses of their works.

*That's* the real game plan.

TCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the
masses.  They constitute an effort to ""democratize"" content
control under the concept of ""moral rights,"" encouraging the
public to overlook the clear public interest issues raised
by the specter of content control, and to confuse these
issues with private interest issues such as privacy and
security.  They are an effort to get the public to jump on
the bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's
really on the line.

In America, we have never supported the concept of ""moral
rights"" which the WPPT professes.  The US Constitution
accords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive
rights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting
the progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the
purpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though
that result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights
statutes such as copyright law.  Our Supreme Court
explicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good
reason.  In America, we implicitly understand the
distinction between expression, the aspect of works to which
copyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make
up a work, to which it does *not* apply.

The reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must
be stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture:
information is free.  It's not that it *wants* to be -- it
*is* and it always has been.  This fact is unassailable,
however, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes
to ""universal content control"" for the sake of so-called
""moral rights"" implemented at the behest of narrow content
industry interests.

TCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage
the general public, and more specifically producers of
information products in general, to identify content control
with ""moral rights,"" blithely overlooking the real
implications of information technology in a free society,
and the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding
the freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the
prospects of information technology crucially depend.

Very nice. Not sure it's worthwhile to pay for that when I'm already
paying for cable modem at home, but... still nice to know I have the
option.

FWIW, slummerville actually has the internet- not just broadband, but
actual broadband competition, which I gather is rare. I had ADSL and two
cable options when I moved in.

Did you actually attempt to order the DSL? Large chunks of somerville have
advertised DSL service that can't actually be obtained. Excuses vary, from
""no available copper"" to ""full DSLAM"", but the folks I know who've wanted
DSL around here have all failed, ending up either with ATTBB, RCN or an
honest-to-god T1.

No. My past experiences with DSL have generally been miserable so I went
with at&t digital cable[1] + cable modem. Still, even the hypothetical
option was a lot better than what I had in the theoretically
tech-friendly Triangle in NC.

Subject: employment market for applied cryptographers?

On the employment situation... it seems that a lot of applied
cryptographers are currently unemployed (Tim Dierks, Joseph, a few
ex-colleagues, and friends who asked if I had any leads, the spate of
recent ""security consultant"" .sigs, plus I heard that a straw poll of
attenders at the codecon conference earlier this year showed close to
50% out of work).

Are there any more definitive security industry stats?  Are applied
crypto people suffering higher rates of unemployment than general
application programmers?  (From my statistically too small sample of
acquaintances it might appear so.)

If this is so, why is it?

- you might think the physical security push following the world
political instability worries following Sep 11th would be accompanied
by a corresponding information security push -- jittery companies
improving their disaster recovery and to a lesser extent info sec
plans.

- governments are still harping on the info-war hype, national
information infrastructure protection, and the US Information Security
Czar Clarke making grandiose pronouncements about how industry ought
to do various things (that the USG spent the last 10 years doing it's
best to frustrate industry from doing with it's dumb export laws)

- even Microsoft has decided to make a play of cleaning up it's
security act (you'd wonder if this was in fact a cover for Palladium
which I think is likely a big play for them in terms of future control
points and (anti-)competitive strategy -- as well as obviously a play
for the home entertainment system space with DRM)

However these reasons are perhaps more than cancelled by:

- dot-com bubble (though I saw some news reports earlier that though
there is lots of churn in programmers in general, that long term
unemployment rates were not that elevated in general)

- perhaps security infrastructure and software upgrades are the first
things to be canned when cash runs short?  

- software security related contract employees laid off ahead of
full-timers?  Certainly contracting seems to be flat in general, and
especially in crypto software contracts look few and far between.  At
least in the UK some security people are employed in that way (not
familiar with north america).

- PKI seems to have fizzled compared to earlier exaggerated
expectations, presumably lots of applied crypto jobs went at PKI
companies downsizing.  (If you ask me over use of ASN.1 and adoption
of broken over complex and ill-defined ITU standards X.500, X.509
delayed deployment schedules by order of magnitude over what was
strictly necessary and contributed to interoperability problems and I
think significantly to the flop of PKI -- if it's that hard because of
the broken tech, people will just do something else.)

- custom crypto and security related software development is perhaps
weighted towards dot-coms that just crashed.

- big one probably: lack of measurability of security -- developers
with no to limited crypto know-how are probably doing (and bodging)
most of the crypto development that gets done in general, certainly
contributing to the crappy state of crypto in software.  So probably
failure to realise this issue or perhaps just not caring, or lack of
financial incentives to care on the part of software developers.
Microsoft is really good at this one.  The number of times they
re-used RC4 keys in different protocols is amazing!


Other explanations?  Statistics?  Sample-of-one stories?

I'm rejoining Fork after a long hiatus, and inspired by the kinds of stuff Rohit and Adam used to post once upon a time... here's a little something that's damn inspiring...

Nalin

http://www.howardsbook.com/ch01/01.html

Chapter One
One Finger for Onions 
On March 15, 1996, I made over a hundred million dollars. That was the day my company, IDT, one of the world's largest Internet and alternative telecommunications providers, went public. As IDT's founder, president, and majority shareholder, I was instantly rich beyond my wildest dreams. People ask me if this was the greatest moment in my business life. It wasn't.

Four months later, on July 18, 1996, we released a new technology, a breakthrough that would eventually cut the cost of international calls by a remarkable 95 percent. That day Sara Grosvenor, the great-granddaughter of Alexander Graham Bell, joined us in New York to use our new technology in order to place the first phone call ever over the network to Susan Cheever, the great-granddaughter of Thomas Watson, in London.

Within twenty-four hours of Ms. Grosvenor saying ""Come here, Ms. Watson, I need to see you"" over our system, CNN, CNBC, and newspapers had spread word of the development to investors and potential users and partners around the world. Combined with a more than fivefold increase in our quarterly revenues for the second year in a row, IDT's stock price started to move upward again. Many people who saw me glowing that morning asked if this was the greatest moment of my business life. It wasn't.

The greatest moment actually occurred approximately twenty-seven years earlier on the morning of July 23, 1970. That was the morning I pushed my newly built hot dog stand past Joe and Vinny's butcher shop on Eastchester Road in the Bronx. Only two months before, Joe had driven me from my after-school job in the butcher shop by forcing me to eat five pounds of rice pudding (a task that took me close to two hours) after catching me sampling the pudding while I waited on a customer at the deli counter.

I couldn't resist stopping in front of the butcher shop on my way to the spot I'd picked out three-quarters of a mile away to set up my stand. As Joe, Vinny, and Joe's nephew, Patsy, came out to see the new stand, I was gloating over the fact that I was now just as independent in business as they were. Nobody could make me clean out the rotten chicken tank anymore. Nobody could send me five miles away on the delivery bike in the snow to deliver ribs to a rich finicky lady who would just send them back to be trimmed, and never tipped more than a quarter. Nobody could make me lay in the sawdust and dig ground-up bones, blood, and fat out of the meat band saw. And, most importantly, nobody could do all this while poking fun at what a jerk I was to get all the dirty jobs. I was only fourteen years old, and the wheels would fall off my homemade hot dog stand many times before that summer ended, but that day, in my mind, I was as rich as a Rockefeller.

Not knowing one whit about elliptic curve math, can you provide 
some expert interpretation of these results?

It looks like the old record for, say, 199 bits, has been
blown out of the water by a factor of ~100,000.

Does this mean that Eliptic Curve encryption is
now easily breakable? Or faster than before with
no loss in strength? Or stronger?

Raw bits are OK, cooked bits are better.

Hate-lit rests on a premise that ""them"" are fundamentally different
critters from ""us"" and thus, by being ""them-like"" they, as a
classification, ""bring it on themselves"" for us to ""correct"" them by
any means gruesome we might choose, after all, it's not /us/ pulling

more than once, and with a straight face.

Call it gay-bashing or whatever, it's convenient tunnel-vision and
lies to justify violence against a creature genetically, morally and
intellectually indistinguishable from your sister.  Go ahead, peel the
skin off a random daughter of each of them and lay them side by side
on the pavement, and you tell me which one was racially guilty, which
one carried the ""infection"" the ""plague"" (note, not the ""antigen"" or
the ""hormone"", which have similar metaphoric effects to philosophy,
but they chose the fear-charged words)

""Make no mistake about it"" it oozes rhetorical vehicles to obfuscate
it's lack of bits paragraph after paragraph in pushing an agenda to
/excuse/ ""our"" violence and suspension of human rights to 'clense'
ourselves of ""them"", the 'non-human' (or lesser-human) objects of its
hate.

What else shall we call it?  Just anti-liberal?  

Better question: What if, as in physics, the laws of human behaviour
are the same everywhere in the Universe?  What if Al Queda is in fact
more like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? 

What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima
gratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this
planet?  

What if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like
our own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for
trade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make
it all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/
/identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs ""fundamentalist islam"",
and they call ours ""imperialist satanism""?

When both sides can call the other ""evil"" to the cheers of their local
public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.

I guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I

Youre right of course - the attack was performed for its effect on
muslims, not for its effect on the US. By showing that it can be done,
they inspire others to follow in their path, or so they hope.

I take some objection to the belabouring of the term fantasy, because it
is somewhat perjorative. Imagining different worlds can often lead the
world to become more like that imagined. Moreso if action is taken on
the basis of those imaginings.

Theres an interesting parralel with the great capitalist dream that
anyone can make anything happen through hard work and a bit of luck.
This is equally a fantasy, but one made to approach reality through
consensus.

An interesting question then becomes, if Al Queda's actions are in
furtherance of a fantasy, what fantasies are George Bush's actions in
furtherace of? How many of the actions of George Bush and the US are
performed for their effect on the US population? For example, how much
showmanship has been put into rebuilding the morale of wall street. Is
this not as much a spirtual investment as the sacrifices Al Queda made?

What cultural myopia is in play here in the US?

I make a point of reading Australian, Britsish and US news. Today I
noticed that the Australian and British news are featuring the Iraqi
overtures to the UN on inspectors, while US news is featuring Iraqi war
preparations (digging bunkers etc).

At a time that the US is withdrawing from international cooperation on
multiple levels, the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies (invisible
preferably) is somewhat appealing. A self fullfilling prophesy, if you
like. Perhaps that's whats at work here.

If somebody maximizes their gratification by slaughtering people, we
shouldn't just try to understand them. We should try to stop them. You
seem to have forgotten this in your moral relativism. Everybody is
justified in their own head. This doesn't mean we forgive mass murders,
or ignore their acts. They are still guilty and abhorrent. We do
understand them better when we see them as a flawed human being, like
any one of us.

Calling ""the other side"" evil is a time-honored tradition. It is less

If it strikes you as being ridiculously bizarre, you're probably right.  
Because it is ridiculous, and bizarre.

No, rather a new breakthrough in ballistic snake oil delivery. So it's
built into a walkthrough gate, and is noninvasive. It's supposed to
analyse brain and heart activity. While you can pick up heartbeat by
Doppler radar, later tells it's realtime DSP on an array of SQIDs. Later
they mention they use passive IR imaging and eye saccade evaluation. Maybe
they're also doing a Kirlian reading, and recording your mana flux, too.
(Conclusive evaluation by entrail reading is nonoptional only for
confirmed terrorists).

So they claim terrorist intent translates in biosignatures they can pick
up by close-distance passive telemetry, in realtime, with a very low
number of false positives, while having no chance to calibrate, in the
field.

Right.

Seems somebody is so awfully eager to pick up a slice of research grant
pie from the heimatland securitate money they haven't even bothered to

grokked the whole piece.   A theory (in this case, that fantasy was
the propagating force/drive?) behind a given act, that from those not
in the fantasy seems morally outrageous, repugnant or unjustified.
He listed many examples, oldies and goodies.   I don't think the

conjecturing -- that this is purely an 'other' offense.   I certainly
didn't read it that way, but it _did_ bother me that he did not
include some of the examples I listed, or as Damien? mentioned on an

This article never got into the bones & blood of what humans are Gary.
  You're assuming too much, dearie.  His was all a psychological game.
I'd be willing to wager that, his point was merely psychological.
That there is a distinguishing characteristic (the fantasy) about
those who are perpetually deluded into a preconceived notion of how
the world needs to work -- his examples were very clear -- a
psychopathological individual and on a lesser extreme, the father who
fantasizes his son as a football player.   I kinda read 'levels' into
that distinguishing characteristic though.   Meaning, just because
you believe in the/a fantasy, does not mean necessarily that you're
going to be an evil terrorist.   It just means you're playing alittle
game in your head, and because of that you are a bit different from
the rest of the wavelengths floating around in the cosmos at that
moment.

I didn't read cleanse or nonhuman anywhere.   Mind telling me where
you saw those words?   Sure, I'll bite that the article had rhetoric.
I'll also bite that he wasn't fair entirely with his theory.   If he
meant it to be a universal (capable of including even the common
father with a football complex dream) he should have included our
delusions in all of this.   But honestly, where in the hell did you
get 'cleanse ourselves of 'them', the 'non-human' (or lesser-human)

Well, as sinister as the schoolboard is, they didn't go kill 4k+
people.   Lets put some of this moral relativism de jour into
perspective here.   Al'Qaeda had a fantasy.  This fantasy involved a
whole mess of 'others' not in their collective fantasy.   This _is_
much like the mafia's collective fantasy about brotherhood and
organized crime, or the biker gang's fantasy about being badasses on
the road or the school board's fantasy about indoctrinating your
children with Jesus, but its not equivalent.

The terrorists went out, and purposely destroyed things, and killed
people.   This is bad, I don't care what universe you're in.   While
the aspect of 'fantasy' can be applied to all groups, and that label
can be equivalent, the perpetration of the fantasy has different
effects and must be judged differently.   Otherwise, whats a genocide?
Just a father-son complex gone terribly awry?

GLM> What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima

So your whole point is we too live in a fantasy.  Sure.   No
questions.  Its the thing that bothered me about the article.   I
think the difference between our fantasy and theirs, is that there are
folks out there, in our fantasy allowed to voice their opinons about
the 'fantasy' and keep folks a bit grounded in the real versus the
made-up.   From what I gather, there are no such guards, or
protections on their end.   Thats the problem with some regeimes over
others.   THey all have bad points -- Ours is in a collective fantasy
that we need to control the oil, masking the intentions behind a very
clever, albiet convienent other fantasy of 'terrorism'.   Point is,
Gary, the 'terrorism' fantasy really happened.  People really died.
I won't argue we're innocent in the perpetration of our fantasy, but
I'll argue that we're not just blindly 'cleansing' 'non-humans'.

GLM> I guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I

Seems also from the news being reported that it's likely they already
have a slice of that pie, which says something about the mindset of
the people handing out the slices.  Ditto for the biometric airport ID
machines.

My personal raw guess: The people with the pie /already/ /know/ the
people with the Ghostbusters Gear, they play golf regularly, have for
years, and perhaps even co-own some private venture that profits win
or lose from the grant.  9-11 seems to have made every
security-oriented-corp shareholder's eyes light up with
red-white-and-blue dollar signs, and like sharks to a cut swimmer or
psychologists to a distressed town, they came swarming on the
motherlode.

I only guess that because the pattern seems historically so
statistically prevalent.

Uh, plague is not action.  No, no one has a problem quarantining
someone who has say, Ebola, or malaria, because diseases do not
require any decisive action -- just contact.

fantasies, still require decisive action, even if its in conjunction
with the way the fantasy works in the individual's brain. Many people
have very strange and obscure fantasies (say wanting to be a model)
that dont' require them to be locked up.

Fantasies aren't nearly as much like plagues.   Not everyone in a
given population necessarily adheres to that given fantasy, whereas
everyone can get a given plague.   (BTW, gary, the whole concept of
monitoring a given 'racial populaiton' for fear of them getting a
plague is silly.  I don't think plagues discriminate)

You're trying to argue for a lock'em all up mentality, when I don't
think anyone but you has even mentioned it.   His point was that
fantaesies were a psychological? explanation for a possible event.
Not that all people who have them, or even have a certain type, need
to be locked up, quarantined, killed, rubbed-out or cleansed.

Expats help Hindi films make dollars and sense even at their own expense

By JEANNE E. FREDRIKSEN

The expatriate in films is nothing new. Casablanca starring Humphrey 
Bogart as the suave, mysterious Rick in Morocco remains the top favorite 
60 years after its release in America. Although expat characters' lives 
are traditionally painted as being extraordinary, the simple fact that 
they live ""elsewhere"" adds a sense of adventure, a dash of romance, and 
a bit of wishful longing. However, expats have never made the kind of 
impact on films that non-resident Indians (NRIs) have with Hindi cinema, 
both at the box office and on the big screen.

According to India's 2001 census, the country's population exceeded the 
1 billion persons milestone, and there are approximately 11 million 
Indians living, working, and studying elsewhere around the world. NRIs 
have become a serious market for the Hindi film industry, particularly 
in the U.K., where approximately 3 percent of the population is 
Indian/Pakistani, and in the U.S., where 1.7 million out of 281.5 
million people are Indian. The rupee box office is now augmented quite 
handsomely by the dollar-and-pound box office, much to the delight of 
directors and producers.

Among the films reporting a half-to-three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar 
box office in the U.S. or the U.K. are Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), Kaho 
Naa Pyaar Hai (2000), Refugee (2000), Lajja (2001), and Asoka (2001). 
The NRI ""million-dollar-box-office club"" boasts such films as Yaadein 
(2001) and Lagaan (2001) in the U.S. Taal (1999), Hum Saath Saath Hain 
(HSSH, 1999), and Mohabbatein (2000) made the mark or better in the U.K. 
Taal and HSSH doubled their U.K. intakes in the U.S. and brought in $2 
million each. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) tallied up $2.6 million in the 
U.K. Most recently, setting a new high-water mark in the overseas box 
office, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (K3G, 2001) grabbed the No. 10 spot its 
first week of release in the U.S. and earned $2.9 million during its 
five-week run. In the U.K., K3G earned nearly $3.6 million over an 18 
week run.

Impressive? Yes, considering that promotion of Hindi films outside of 
the Indian community is virtually zero, although that may be on the 
brink of changing slightly. If nothing else, the figures indicate that 
the NRI spends a big chunk of change on the films.

During the past decade, the inclusion of NRI characters in both 
commercial and non-commercial films has been on the rise, and in a 
circular logic, it's only natural that they have become a part of these 
films' stories. Each NRI touches someone in India, and these ""global 
Indians,"" as filmmaker Subhash Ghai has called them, cannot be shrugged 
off as a passing phase. Films featuring or ""made for"" NRIs have been 
criticized by some in India, but in reality, many of those films have 
performed extremely well at the Indian box office. Could this speak to 
the lure of adventure and the romance of the NRI?

The first Hindi blockbuster to spotlight NRI characters was Dilwale 
Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ, 1995), the story of two young people who grew 
up Indian in London. DDLJ introduced us to the mischievous, 
prank-pulling Raj, who in the beginning fails to graduate but succeeds 
in pilfering a case of beer from an Indian-owned convenience store. In 
the end, he steadfastly applies Indian sensibilities in his pursuit of 
the rebellious-but-trapped Simran as her unwanted arranged marriage 
approaches. Very possibly, because of this juxtaposition of traits, 
attitudes, and events, DDLJ enjoys the distinction of being the 
longest-continually-running film in Indian cinema history.

Popularity aside, there is the ongoing issue regarding accuracy in the 
characterization of NRIs in films. Often they are drawn as stereotypes, 
which are easy to lean on, requiring neither depth nor dimension. 
Because of this, Hindi filmmakers may be said to straddle the border 
separating East and West, staying securely at home and dipping into 
their highly-fantasized world of the Indian diaspora.

In many cases, commercial Hindi films present an overly-devised sense of 
the NRI as being either corruptly-Westernized or as being more homesick 
than a child gone away to camp for the first time. While these concepts 
may carry a certain truth, the corresponding misconceptions come from 
the minds of the at-home Indians, who wag a seemingly-envious finger at 
the NRI's ability to exist in two worlds: one allowing space and upward 
mobility, the other offering traditions and history.

Pompous, materialistic, alcohol-drinking, cigarette-smoking, 
drug-taking, affair-having, spoiled brats …

The first Hindi film I saw was Subhash Ghai's Pardes (1997). Despite 
encouraging me to see more films, it made me wonder if ""NRI"" actually 
meant ""Not Really Indian."" If the NRI characters weren't silly, whiney 
troublemakers, they were mean and nasty, embracing every possible 
negative human quality in stark contrast to the pristine Kusum Ganga. 
Even the dialogue and song lyrics in the film were designed to instruct 
the viewer that the West is inferior but one can still bring India back 
into one's life. The film is propaganda at its finest and filled with 
relentless reminders of good vs. evil, purity vs. corruption, right vs. 
wrong, traditional vs. modern … in short India vs. the West.

But this is not where the negativity ends.

Very often, there is a ""dress code"" for the female characters to help 
the viewer understand her measure of purity or wickedness: the more 
traditionally-dressed, the more Indian the woman. Unsurprisingly, this 
does not seem to carry over to the men's characters.

Running alongside this can be the ""training guide"" in which NRIs are 
constantly reeducated that ""This is not India …,"" ""This is not America 
…,"" ""Only in India …,"" ""This is our culture."" The repetition seems less 
designed to be a natural part of life than to foster reinforcement, as 
if NRIs are too ignorant to appreciate it the first time.

When Indians achieve success and wealth, have large homes, and own their 
companies in these films, they are industrious, clever, and respected 
businessmen. The NRI equivalent is held up to a double standard and 
considered materialistic. Even the printed synopsis of Taal in the Eros 
Entertainment/B4U DVD booklet refers to the NRI characters' ""world of 
ruthless materialism."" On the other hand, the Mumbai-based, plagiarizing 
Vikrant Kapoor character is likeable enough and presented as an 
opportunist, which seems to be a step up.

Italy is an unlikely origin for an NRI and offspring in a Hindi film, 
but Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (2000) filled the bill. For all the film's 
splendor, it was regrettable that the Indo-Italian Sameer was presented 
as a naïve, bumbling nerd who had little going for him beyond his 
singing ability.

Yaadein gave us a kind and loving, if slightly confused, single parent 
from London raising three daughters who suffer enough issues to put a 
therapist into a tailspin. As if that weren't enough, the film includes 
an American-raised brat who wants nothing to do with parents, settling 
down, or having babies—hardly the ideal Indian bride-to-be.

And what happens when a married NRI couple splits into the ""modern"" vs. 
the ""old-fashioned?"" The wife is tossed out like the garbage and sent 
home to India as punishment for being unreceptive to having affairs 
outside of marriage. Such is the initial setup for Lajja, Rajkumar 
Santoshi's look into the world of Indian women.

Show me the way to go home …

The other extreme of NRIs in film is the homesick, culture-craving, 
more-patriotic-than-thou Indian. Building their own mini-Indias for 
maxi-memories, this NRI portrayal takes a real issue and magnifies it to 
unreal proportions. And no film illustrates that as extravagantly as the 
lush and sumptuous Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (K3G).

Not only did K3G enjoy a healthy run at home, it exploded worldwide onto 
theater screens in Indian communities last December and played to packed 
houses for weeks. And K3G is a film in which everything—homes, 
transportation, finances, fashion, holidays, events, emotions, and 
tears—sets a new standard for the term ""larger-than-life.""

In K3G, much of the post-interval footage takes place in England. For 
Anjali, life in London simmers with a patriotic zeal and an 
all-consuming homesickness manifested in the meticulous maintenance of 
Indian customs and rituals while she separates herself from her 
surroundings. Her need for India is so overwhelming that she relies on 
the false protection of mocking people and places outside of her own 
family and home.

Overkill? Certainly, as writer-director Karan Johar's inflated 
representation of what have become some of the filmi passions of the 
typical NRI. But when it boils down to the common denominators without 
the fanfare, flash, and fervor, even those who move across country miss 
their families and familiar surroundings; one always retains a credible 
amount of home-turf loyalty; and if one's heritage is lost, the person 
is rendered as no more than a racial statistic.

""Those living in India are surrounded by our culture every minute, even 
if they don't realize it,"" says Vivek Malhotra, a thirty-something NRI 
and business owner in the Chicago area. ""Here it's different, but we 
will always be Indian,"" he continues, striking at the heart of the 
perceived problem. ""Sometimes, I feel that the movies think we've 
forgotten that. Maybe the filmmakers should spend some time finding out 
who we are. I really don't think they have a clue.""

On the upside is a beneficial aspect for the children of NRIs. ""It's 
good that these films show our kids what happens in India—the 
traditions, customs, values,"" says Parag Gandhi, a long time theater 
owner and promoter of Hindi films in Chicago. ""They may be modernized in 
India, but the traditional values remain."" And many popular films target 
the late-teens, twenty-something demographic. ""Films such as Dilwale 
Dulhania Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, and K3G,"" adds Gandhi, ""are 
examples of films that are half traditional, half modern, striking a 
balance between the two for all of the markets.""

Another positive consideration is that not all films show NRIs in a 
questionable light. Caricatures of NRIs have been challenged in 
commercial films like Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, Dil Chhata Hai (2001), Monsoon 
Wedding (2001), and the recent Kitne Door Kitne Paas, all of which 
present NRIs as more realistic, more human characters. Aa Ab Laut Chalen 
offers a variety of NRI personalities from the selfish, the conniving, 
and the party animal to the lovable cabbies and the pandit-cop who make 
the best of their situations without complaint. Interestingly, the film 
also dares to include shop owners, Dunkin' Donuts clerks, gas station 
attendants: characters who aren't weighed down by palatial surroundings, 
corporate crises, or overseas judgments.

The U.S., the U.K., and Australia are represented in Bombay Boys (1999) 
by three young men coming/returning to Bombay, India for personal 
reasons. In a refreshing reversal of the typical attitude concerning 
NRIs in film, the boys are the ""good"" Indians, and everyone they meet 
has some relationship with the darker side of the city. At its most 
basic, the film shows that if something is lost, it won't necessarily be 
found in India.

Even the non-commercial, multi-award-winning Bawandar (2001) 
incorporates an NRI as a connecting thread in the piecing together of 
Sanvri Devi's story. Curious, passionate about women's rights, the 
Indo-English journalist represents the fact that the story has a wider 
interest than a small, rural village.

Stepping outside of the Hindi film industry for a moment, the 
English/Telegu film Hyderabad Blues (1998) and the English/Tamil film 
Mitr—My Friend (2002), both smaller-budget films built on delivering 
messages without preaching, deserve mention. The former engages in the 
questioning of, rather than the criticism of, East vs. West, and the 
latter examines the challenges faced by women, NRIs, and their families. 
The characters and stories of both films enjoy respect in their 
presentation, partially due to the existence of layered issues that are 
revealed and resolved (or not) without finger-snapping swiftness or 
clichéd answers. Hyderabad Blues enjoyed a 31-week run in Mumbai alone, 
and Mitr—My Friend is currently one of the most-rented films in Indian 
communities in the U.S.

While the inclusion of NRIs in Hindi films does not guarantee box office 
success outside of India, it does send a strong signal that filmmakers 
acknowledge this constantly growing and lucrative audience sector. If 
the big-budget, big box-office commercial films coming out of Mumbai 
often seem to bite one of the hands that feeds it, has the box office 
anywhere been adversely affected? Well … no, not by any charted reports 
that can be found. And that, itself, sends a loud and clear message back 
to the industry in Mumbai: ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it.""

Nevertheless, when filmmakers who see NRIs as falling only to the evil 
side of Western ways look beyond their assumptions, perhaps they will 
discard their reliance on stereotypes and start paying their overseas 
family an increased measure of respect. And when filmmakers who take the 
homesick and patriotic themes beyond believability analyze their own 
feelings, perhaps they will realize that what NRIs hold dear in their 
hearts is no different from what those at home should be proud of. n

Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge

So globally successful is the film that in 1999 it warranted a billboard 
outside Shinjuku train station in Tokyo, Japan, announcing its 
screenings sponsored by India Center there. Shinjuku is the 
entertainment center of Tokyo, and there is plenty of high-profile 
competition for attention, attendance, and box office. In Japan, where 
Indian films enjoy a certain popularity with the natives, the country's 
1995 population census of 125.6 million persons showed only 4,244 were 
Indian with an additional 13,589 being other South Asians. Without 
question, DDLJ continues to be a favorite whenever, wherever offered for 
viewing.

Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham

According to a report in the South China Morning Post in January, 2002, 
all screenings of K3G in December, 2001, were sell-outs in Hong Kong, 
while pirated copies of the film were the hottest items circulating on 
the island. Hong Kong's 2001 population census of 6.3 million people 
revealed that 18,543 were Indian and another 23,581 were Nepalese and 
Pakistani. K3G's popularity in the Special Administrative Region was 
impressive because Hong Kong enjoys being the third-largest producer of 
films by volume after India and the U.S.

Bhansali's Musical Heaven

By ANIRUDDH CHAWDA

DEVDAS (Universal, 2002). Hindi film soundtrack. Music: Ismail Darbar. 
Lyrics: Nusrat Badr

For perhaps the most eagerly anticipated film of the year, filmmaker 
Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas had to deliver a score that not only met 
the hype but also let Ismail Darbar prove that the mega-selling Hum Dil 
De Chuke Sanam was no one-time flash in the pan. By devising a 
semi-classical, once-in-a-decade, 100 percent ""Indian"" musical score, 
Bhansali and Darbar emerge victorious in baking and serving a 10-layer 
monumental soundtrack.

What is most groundbreaking is the powerful one-two punch of lyrics by 
newcomer Nusrat Badr and the from-soul-voice of first-timer Shreya 
Ghosal. Ghosal's voice, reminiscent of both Suman Kalyanpur with a 
slightly thicker pitch and Anuradha Paudwal without the nasal monotone, 
is the most original singing voice since Kavita Subramaniam appeared in 
the Mangeshkar mold. Ghosal's ""Silsila ye chaahat ka"" is a sultry 
tabla-dominated opening to 52 minutes of sheer musical bliss. ""Maar 
daala"" (Subramaniam, KK) is an excellent example of the use of classical 
ragas to complement, rather than fill-in, interludes between verses. On 
""Kahe chhed,"" Pandit Birju Maharaj, using his own tune, adds an 
intoxicating opening for Madhuri Dixit's vocals and Subramaniam to 
finish out a piercing song of longing.

While a combination of Ghosal and Subramaniam give life to on-screen 
lip-synching for Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai, on the male side Udit 
Narayan fronts for Shah Rukh Khan. Narayan's on-target ""Bairi piya,"" a 
duet with Ghosal, could find company in many Lata-Rafi duets of yore. 
The up-tempo ""Chalak chalak"" again smoothly floats Narayan with Vinod 
Rathod and Ghosal while Subramaniam and Ghosal's jugalbandhi on ""Dola re 
dola"" simply shakes the rafters.

Packaged in Universal's Bombay plant, the earliest CD pressings have a 
cheap, paper-thin casing. Purists may consider replacing the cheap cover 
with a store-bought sturdier one. At a suggested Bombay retail value of 
about $2 and selling like hot cakes stateside for $10 a pop, Devdas is 
without doubt a huge profit-maker for the multinational music marketer. 
But buyers beware: avoid being distracted by bootleg CDs. This 
exceptional music and exceptionally well-recorded CD deserve 
unadulterated musical glory. Pop in only a properly copyrighted, 
original CD and let Darbar & Co. whisk you away on a magical musical 
ride.

Lifelong cinephile Aniruddh Chawda lives, works, and writes from 
Wisconsin, on America's north coast.

You aren't the first person to ask this question, but over the last few
years there have been some good answers to this coming from the genetics
research folks.  As I understand it, there is a growing body of genetic
evidence that European immune systems are substantially tougher and more
resistant to a wider range of infectious diseases than those found in other
peoples around the world, including a surprisingly wide range of hereditary
immunities and partial immunities/resistance to common viruses and bacteria
found around the world.  As a result, when the first wholesale mixing of
people from different parts of the world started occurring on a regular
basis, the Europeans fared much better than most others.

The standard theory for this is that Europe was the first major region of
the planet to become densely populated and urbanized (to the extent that
they ""urbanized"" a thousand years ago).  Because of this, Europe was a
festering cauldron of disease without the benefit of modern sanitation and
medicine for a thousand plus years, much more so than the rest of the world
and suffered from repeated large-scale epidemics and plagues that took
severe tolls on the population.  Modern ethnic Europeans have genetics that
survived a unique and brutal culling process by a rather extensive range of
diseases over dozens of generations.

What the geneticists are discovering is that for a great many of the world's
most common infectious diseases, there is a percentage of the ethnically
European population that has hereditary immunity and an even larger segment
that has at least some hereditary resistance compared to people from other
parts of the world.  And for most ethnic Europeans it isn't just one
disease, they have varying levels of genetic resistance to a veritable
cornucopia of infectious diseases.  Because of similarities in the
mechanisms and characteristics of viruses and other pathogens around the
world to ones that Europeans were exposed to, the robust defenses their
genetics provided them against their native diseases frequently imparted
some resistance to diseases which they had never been exposed.

Cheers,

See Jared Diamond's excellent ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" for the story.

Eurasians had outrageously huge, dense, populations to incubate and
immunize whole classes of fatal diseases in, and unobstructed
east-west trans-supercontinental disease transport vectors (horses,
the silk road, sailing ships) to spread them around with.

Game over, man. Same thing with war, technology, crops, domestic
animals and everything else worth having in life. :-).

Right, there was definitely a relatively high density in Mexico, and
much less elsewhere.  Population estimates vary wildly and about all
your average skeptic can do is take geometric means to get ballpark
figures.  While Central America may have had 20 or 30 million, vast
areas of South America were uninhabited and other places very
sparsely e.g., the plains Indians in what is now the U.S. may have
been 2 million or so.

There are those who claim that the Mexican population declined from
20 something million to circa 8 or 10 million in the 16th century,
certainly, in part due to infectious diseases new and old, and other
factors, and was probably in decline before contact.  Others claim it
declined from 80-ish million to 3 or 4 million and somehow deduce 95%
mortality from imported diseases, and have a pretty clear agenda which
makes me (for one) take their claims with a large grain of salt.

About all that is certain is that anyone alive in 1500 was dead in 1600,
in the Americas or elsewhere.

Another theory is that Europe was a rural backyard until the Renaissance,
certainly when compared to big urban centres like Constantinople and Baghdad.

I don't know the genetic studies of which you speak, but I know of one that
is sort-of relevant: apparently men of Ashkenazi descent are susceptible
to sickle-cell anemia and the probable reason is that the same genetic
factor that causes that also protects women from tuberculosis (IIRC), which
would have come in handy in central European towns at a time when the Jewish
population was a lot more urbanised than average Joes.

The tooth fairy?

There were never millions of natives in Florida (until recently :).

Cortez never went to Florida, AFAIK.  Ponce de Leon discovered it.
The Indian peoples he found there stuck around until a bunch of them
moved to Cuba with the Spanish when a bunch of Seminole Indians
invaded from the North with the English, in the seventeenth century.
The remainder merged in with the new population, or died, or whatever,
and their culture disappeared.

When you can hold and sponsor a giant restrictive device (using giant
restrictorism principles, then,) conference/exhibition and get 30 invited
exhibitors, with lecturedemos, on elastic polity, concepts of public
responsibility have gone rather far off theory into quartering.

The way I reckon it, they plan on fixing the seats/plane and security
problem by further sectioning airplanes:
	1- Checked luggage
	2- Calcium formerly in passengers and crew
	3- The rest of the passengers
	4- The cabin and crew, who get a calcium substitute more
	   readily controlled by a quorum of preservatory agencies.
	5 (optional:) - Premium services and DRM for checked laptops.
They reactivate calcium channels and put the calcium back when
you arrive.  If you don't like it, you have to claim it as they put the
calcium back, subject to retries, and you have to remember the flight
number you actually arrived on to do that.

...and you suddenly know all about vendors!

I actually hear about this from people who are researchers in
pharma-biotech.  My authority isn't much better than ""they say"", but they
say that they've uncovered quite a few advantageous mutations in the ethnic
European genome that protect against quite a few different diseases,
mutations which are not found in various African, Asian, and other
populations that they also study.  Based on the genome research (as it
relates to infectious disease, which is among their primary interests) of
these various populations around the world, they and others are finding far
more protective mutations in the Caucasian/European genome than in the other
race populations they survey.  All the races and ethnic subgroups usually
have genetic mutations specific to them that provide protection against
specific infectious diseases.  What they are saying is that they are finding
far more in the European genome than in the others, and it isn't because
nobody is looking elsewhere.

You can find studies and results like this in the science wires.  For
example, one which I remember off the top of my head is the identified
genetic mutation that makes something like 1% of Caucasians immune to HIV-1,
and another 10-20% or so resistant to it.  Obviously, the protective
mutation occurred at some point in time prior to HIV-1 being introduced into
the European population.  What the researchers I've talked to seem to be
saying is that Europeans express a lot more of these types of gene
mutations, with similar protections from infectious disease, than other
populations.  Nobody really knows why for sure.  On the upside, identifying
genetic immunities to infectious disease helps the bio-techs come up with
pharmacological solutions for people that don't have immunity.

Small nitpick:  Sprint PCS wasn't really first to market with their high 
speed data service.  Some would say they were actually last to market.  The 
only thing that was first about this is what they're calling ""nationwide 
coverage"", and you could even (and perhaps should) argue with that.

Can you clarify why you think this is so?

I'm in the midst of an ongoing argument with a guy who works for me about 
this very subject.  He, like you, thinks that things like MMS are going to 
change the world.  I am not convinced.

What exactly about sending pictures to each other is going to have such a 
huge impact?  I'm waiting to be convinced.  I just don't see how it changes 
human communication in any really amazing way - and no one who believes it 
has yet done a good job explaining it to me.  I can understand SMS taking 
off, since communicating short text messages can be very useful in many 
situations.  However, I just don't see what's the compelling reason for 
sending pictures around to each other on a regular basis.  Are there 
instances when it makes sense?  Sure, I can think of plenty where it's a 
nice to have, but very few where it would be a ""man, I need this"" type of 
feature.

I mean, right now, at my desk, it's easy for me to text message with lots 
of people, and I do all the time.  If I wanted to, I could also very easily 
snap a picture and send it to them, but I don't.  I did once, after I got a 
really bad haircut, and a friend wanted to see how it looked - but that's a 
fairly limited use.  Obviously, that's just one case, and maybe I'm just 
too old (argh!) to really ""get"" this new photo taking and sharing stuff, 
but I'm really trying to understand.

So, I'm not saying it won't be a ""fundamental change in human 
communications"", but I'd just like to know why you think it will be?

here is the latest in what I'm seeing...

* Even knowing a CTO/CEO/CFO may not even get your resume looked at, the
feedback I'm getting is that hiring managers are only considering family
and extended family for jobs - everyone has plenty of unemployed relatives.

* Most job sites are now almost empty - so the practice of posting ""resume
bait"" jobs is coming to an end. The postings they do have are months old
bait. This is now a completely pointless way to look for a job.

* We're almost flatlne in jobs created for several months, where population
growth needs about 120k jobs a month to keep things steady.

* Unemployment rates are only staying steady becasue people drop out of the
workforce number after they cant find a job for a long time. The ""not in
labor force"" is rising 400k a month. International numbers are no better -
technology is replacing people, especially the people tha tmake the
technoogy.

* Grad school programs are stuffed full of people for every non-tech major.
Colleges are having big headaches dealing with all the day-job refugees.

* Spam for porn, ink, and stocks has dropped off, spam (the english ones I
see subject lines for) now seems to be dominated by work-at-home scams and
resume services. That's got to be a BAD sign.

'Siberia Bound: Chasing the American Dream on Russia's Wild Frontier' by 
Alexander Blakely

Reviewed by David Tuller
Sunday, August 18, 2002; Page BW08


SIBERIA BOUND
Chasing the American Dream On Russia's Wild Frontier
By Alexander Blakely
Sourcebooks. 320 pp. $22.95

Judging from Siberia Bound, Alexander Blakely seems like a pretty cool 
guy -- adventurous, engaging and fun to hang out with. After all, most 
chroniclers of Russian life base their tales in Moscow or, alternately, 
St. Petersburg, the most livable of Russia's not-very-livable cities. 
Deciding instead to settle in a former academic community outside of 
Novosibirsk, one of Siberia's major cities, Blakely set out to pursue, 
as his book's subtitle declares, ""the American dream on Russia's wild 
frontier.""

Blakely, who moved to Siberia after finishing college with an economics 
degree, has a breezy writing style. And although his book is flawed in 
many respects, it does include some sharp observations of life in 
Russia. ""Usually with construction,"" he tells us, for instance, ""you 
have two choices: 1) you can do it quickly, or 2) you can do it right. 
The Soviet construction worker . . . takes his time doing things wrong.""

Anyone who has spent time in Siberia knows that its inhabitants are a 
breed apart. They disdain their compatriots in the country's Western 
regions and pride themselves -- perhaps excessively -- on their courage, 
strength and inner fortitude. Siberia, in fact, occupies a space in the 
Russian national psyche similar to that of the Wild West in American 
mythology. The efforts throughout the 16th and 17th centuries to settle 
Siberia's vast expanse and exploit its natural resources still resonate 
with Russians. So does the region's role as a convenient dumping ground 
for criminals and political dissidents during the czarist centuries and 
as home to the cruel network of gulags in Soviet times.

Unfortunately, little of this rich brew of history and myth makes an 
appearance in Siberia Bound. Neither do lots of other pertinent facts. 
Russians often say that, in Russia, anything can happen -- and usually 
does. So it's easy to believe that two young men could establish a 
chocolate business on little more than hope, smarts and chutzpah. But 
while Blakely describes establishing a cocoa-bean importing business 
with his friend Sasha, we never learn how they met in the first place or 
why he believes Sasha to be a trustworthy associate. The two of them 
strike a deal to sell their beans to a local chocolate factory, yet we 
find out virtually nothing about the chocolate the factory produces. Is 
it tasty? Disgusting? Are we talking chocolate bars, chocolate truffles 
or chocolate syrup? A few details would go a long way here.

The author has the makings of a terrific story. But even though Siberia 
Bound includes frequent humorous episodes, Blakely generally fails to 
transform the pungent ingredients into a satisfying meal. The constant 
descriptions of encounters and conversations ultimately differ little 
from one another. People are forever winking, smirking and slapping one 
another on the back. Slamming down shots of vodka and making sentimental 
toasts to women and friendship play an inevitable role in any account of 
Russian life, but reading about such occasions becomes tiresome after 
the 20th or 30th repetition.

Blakely is also given to facile comments that are meant to sound smart 
but often fall flat. ""Democracy and the free market, the best 
institutions the West had to offer, stormed over the borders and ran 
deep into Russia,"" he tells us. ""But like all foreign armies throughout 
history, they quickly were spread too thin and became diluted."" And then 
there's this summation of his time in Russia: ""Those four years have 
left me with a lifetime of rabid ambivalence to chew on until I've got 
no teeth left.""

Blakely manages to include a few unpleasant -- and wholly unnecessary -- 
laughs at the expense of Chinese workers and gays. And although I like 
wordplay as much as the next guy, it's jarring when non-English-speaking 
characters make puns in English. ""In a pinch,"" says one character, a 
chocolate factory director who warns Blakely not to store extra cocoa 
beans on site, ""I'm afraid we would probably take a pinch.""

Some of these faults wouldn't matter if Siberia Bound were a picaresque 
novel or an account that didn't aspire to authenticity. But the effect 
here is to undermine a reader's faith in the narrator's reliability and 
to reduce most of the characters to the stock figures encountered in 
dozens of other accounts of Russian life. So in the end, I believed the 
broad contours of Blakely's story but found it hard to take seriously 
many of the particulars. And his ultimate conclusion -- that capitalism, 
material comfort and wealth do not bring happiness -- hardly qualifies 
as a revelation. •

I do however disagree with Joe in that it needs to be 2+MPixels to 
be useful.  Value is not always necessarily defined by quality 
(just look at 802.11).

If I had a self-contained communications unit that let me share 
things: documents, the weather, my new hairdo, by newborn baby, 
etc. and it fit in my pocket then it might encourage me to share 
those things more often.  If we're talking on the phone and you ask 
me what the weather is like and I say ""hang on"", outstretch the 
device with my arm extended, press a button, and instantly send you 
a picture on me with blue sky in the background, that has value.

But if I say ""hang on"", fumble around in my briefcase for a digital 
camera, and  after 5 minutes of plugging and praying with USB 
finally am able to take a photo of me, bound by several feet of 
cable and multiple devices, well, that doesn't really have value.

If I'm a Paparazzi I'd love to be able to send high-res photos 
using my mobile phone because that has real economic impact, and I 
could put up with the hassle for the amount of time it saves me.  
However, I don't think that is the market that Sprint PCS is 
contemplating.

The fact that Sprint has not made the assumption that both the 
sender and recipient of the picture are using their mobile phones 
will help this survive. Gets around the whole ""fax"" problem (where 
both sender and receiver have to have faxes in order for that 
technology to be useful).

On the whole, not very useful for regular Joes (pun intended).  Put 
the camera in the phone (even a low-res one) and then it'd at least 
be cool.

This little domain went to China....,bitbitch@magnesium.net,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Mon, 19 Aug 2002 22:19:17 -0400","The RIAA continues to amaze me.    Everyone might want to grok the
news yahoo has:

http://rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/nm/tc_nm/inlinks/*http://Listen4ever.com


And if you're really bored, go ahead and read the papers that were
filed by the RIAA against the major backbone providers.

http://www.riaa.com/pdf/Listen4Ever.pdf


So it looks like the RIAA is getting bored with its usual tack of
suing the peer-to-peer services, and is instead using the DMCA
to sue ISPs and backbones into compliance --  They want said backbones
to block the ip address of the listen4ever.com server due to
listen4ever's alleged infringement of copyright.  To quote
the Motion that the RIAA issued:  ""Plaintiffs request that
the Court issue a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to block
communication to and from Listen4ever's servers that travel through
Defendants' backbone routing systems"".

At least according to the RIAA (probably for bonus terror tactics )
the Listen4ever site is even more formidable than that bane of p2p
goodness, Napster, due to the fact that its on a centralized server,
out of their reach of RIAA/DMCA control (its located in China), and
because according to the RIAA it facilitates the downloading of entire albums.
Apparently listen4ever has a few other sites floating around, and the RIAA has been
unsuccessful in getting any of them to voluntarily surrender
service(1).

Gotta love the RIAA for jumping into this lawsuit with the customer's
interests in mind.  How lawyers can write drivel along the lines of
'if you dont stop these guys, we'll run out of money and we won't be
able to supply you new music!' just blows my mind, especially in this
day and age.   The RIAA has enough money to file inane lawsuits
against backbone providers, but they don't have enough money to
produce new artists?  Something seems wrong here.

Here's my problem.  Say the RIAA wins in court, and the backbone
providers comply.   Their biggest hurdle is now accomplished, and one
hell of a terrible precident is/can be set.   At least in the RIAA's
case, I'm sure once they get a Court-mandated Ok for this particular
site, they'll just go ahead, write their nice friendly lawyer letters,
and demand that subsequent IP addresses also be blocked, as they too
route to sites that are problematic to the RIAA.

Even worse, the concept that other groups (the first that flashed into
my little brain being the Scientologists) also decide that this is the way
to go.   If the RIAA prevails, they have record set, albiet in NY
only, that can be pointed back to, and used in other cases.
Eventually this will hit a large enough court that precident will set,
 and we have a very quiet, very non-reported event occuring from then
 on, the systematic C&Ding of the Internet.   Anything that violates the
DMCA, given its takedown provisions, might now potentially
fall prey to a Cease & Desist letter.  Rather than appealing, the
backbone providers will just agree -- as they seem likely to do
'provided a court order'.

Point being is that soon this won't take a court order.  A nastygram
will suffice and we'll wonder where all the new
music/information/dissenting opinions/ criticisms went.

This is a scary road we're running down here.   So nice to see that
its still hush-hush in the geek community.

Whats more bizzare is some of the support(?) that the RIAA seemed to
get.   I'm curious for instance, how Dave Farber got dragged into
this...  (2) Dave, you still read FoRK?

(1) Save for one, lmp3.com, which was listed as a redirect site in the
court documents, has since gone down.   Their website has a humorous little note:  ""Lmp3
will be closed and will never come back! "".  Listen4ever.com is not
responding, but i'm not quite sure if thats due to backbone compliance
or the site being overburdened.

After picking up the land-line phone mid-day (always a bad idea) only to 
slam it down before the telemarketer even spoke, I have in mind an 
invention.  If my brain can detect the crosstalk from a call-center before 
the human, sub-human, or machine starts speaking, why not have a box that 
just hangs up for me?  Maybe it could blow a police whistle (play a 
sample) into the phone first.

Currently, a strategy of leaving the machine on as a screener works pretty 
well, but I still get Carey-on-RIAA style mad when the damn phone rings 
and it's NOT anyone I want to talk to.

.....

I want to like Spider Robinson's works.  Really.  I mean having a ""Bridge 
of Birds"" attraction in the ""China that never was"" portion of the theme 
part in ""The Free Lunch....""   But, I really fell for his anti-paparatzi 
device (invented by a princess Diana fan).   Doggone.  I've now completely 
reasoned my way around it.  It has a built-in defense against the first 
obvious way of confounding it, but that leads directly to an exploit that 
uses off the shelf hardware that a paparatzi ought to have in her kit.
That's so often the problem with Robinson.  He doesn't think that you the 
reader are nearly so smart as he.  Heh.   I admit that reading a lot of 
slushpile manuscripts does not improve one's opinion of fellow-man, but
I always resent him for not being thorough.

I didn't mind the ads. The problem is that the ad
server Opera puts on your machine is a PIG. Every
time it goes to change the ad, it thrashes my
laptop for thirty seconds. So no, I don't mind
the ad, but I do mind that serving ads cripples

Alas, Mozilla is also a PIG. So I'm back to using

I'm not convinced that that classical liberalism is a good solution

----------------------------------------------------------
*IWT Bans RIAA From Accessing Its Network*

*August 19, 2002*

Information Wave Technologies has announced it will actively deny the 
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) from accessing the 
contents of its network. Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new 
plan to access computers without owner's consent for the sake of 
protecting its assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its 
customers at risk of unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and 
invasion of privacy to say the least.

Due to the nature of this matter and RIAA's previous history, we feel 
the RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client's browser after 
the browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access 
and/or tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, 
Information Wave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA's 
web site. Information Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the 
RIAA to thwart this policy and apply additional filters to protect our 
customers' data.

Information Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella 
network from its security research and development network (honeynet) 
which will offer files with popular song titles derived from the 
Billboard Top 100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will 
take place, these files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the 
length of a 3 to 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients 
which connect to our peer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt 
to illegally access the network will be immediately blacklisted from 
Information Wave's network. The data collected will be actively 
maintained and distributed from our network operations site.

The placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA's piracy 
elimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety 
of our customers' data attached to our network from hackers or corporate 
espionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.

If you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this policy, 
please e-mail riaa@informationwave.net <mailto:riaa@informationwave.net>.

Helps that palladium is in fact a heavy metal.  Man, perhaps Pd even
_has_ a half-life on the decay path from plutonium down to lead or
something.  That would be very funny.

And the antonym? Odyssielded. Rhymes with shielded.

http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/Odysseus.html

Odysseus was the first to learned the Palladium Oracles from the Seer Hellenus.
Odysseus neutralised (neutronised?) Palladium's defence for Troy.
Odysseus invented the first Trojan Horse.

Incidentally public revelation of the Palladium is supposed to be on
Seventh Day to the Ides of Jun, i.e. 8th. June. The Newsweek article was
a bit late.

Oh.  OK.
 
These results don't help break EC crypto at all.
 
With RSA, you pick a number with secret factors and to break the
cryptosystem, you can factor the number.  Due to fast sub-exponential
algorithms for factoring, the number had better be 1024 bits at the
very least (record = 524 bits).
 
With EC, you pick a curve and pick points on the curve with secret
discrete logarithm.  To break the cryptosystem you can compute a
discrete log but the best algorithms for random curves are exponential
(record = 109 bits, for a slightly special curve).
 
Up until now, people pick curves chosen from a small fixed set.  One
choice is a few curves with special properties that originally were
chosen to make point-counting easier, and can also speed up the crypto
operations, but in some cases they can also speed up attacks, not on
curves deployed at the moment but the danger exists.  The other
choice is to precompute a handful of random curves.  The NSA did this
a few years ago when it took hours on a fast machine and NIST
standardized those curves.
 
What changes is that it is now possible is to generate your own curves
on an ordinary PC.  This has been getting easier and easier, with
small curves taking seconds on a fast machine since a year or two.
Now even reasonably big curves take seconds on a typical PC.
 
This means that you don't have to rely on standard curves but can
distribute risk over many curves in case some get broken at some
stage.  In certain circumstances you can even keep the curve itself
secret so an attacker doesn't know which discrete log to try to
compute!  There isn't really a good analogy with RSA, but imagine
wanting to factor a number and you don't even know what it is...
 
So basically recent progress has made new things feasible and this
makes them even more so.  The underlying primitives for signing,
encoding and so on are not affected, but the security vibes get better.

If the situation in Egypt is anything
like the situation in the Philippines,
it's because people (due to a strange
desire for jobs) squat on land which
they don't own.*

For people to be able to buy their own
land, capitalism must be healthy, but
not triumphant; there need to be too
many capitalists, not too few.

in india before independence?)

My impression is that France is not anywhere near the ""Permit Raj""

like India's has.

But De Soto's work is perhaps just as important or more so.  He hasn't
dealt specifically with India, but I recall examples from Peru,
Philippines, and Egypt.  In Lima, his team took over a year (I think it
was 2) working 8 hr days to legally register a 1 person company.  In the
Philippines, getting legal title can take 20 years.  In Egypt, about 80%
of the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially
illegal.

India hasn't been helped by its socialism.  Socialism has certainly
helped strangle the country in permits.  But perhaps De Soto is right
that the real crippling thing is keeping most of the people out of the
legal, official property system.

Putting most of the people in the property system was something the west
only finished about 100 years ago, or Japan did 50 years ago.  It wasn't
easy, but we live in a society that doesn't even remember we did it.

Experts Scale Back Estimates of World Population Growth
By BARBARA CROSSETTE

Demography has never been an exact science. Ever since social thinkers
began trying to predict the pace of population growth a century or two ago,
the people being counted have been surprising the experts and confounding
projections. Today, it is happening again as stunned demographers watch
birthrates plunge in ways they never expected.

Only a few years ago, some experts argued that economic development and
education for women were necessary precursors for declines in population
growth. Today, village women and slum families in some of the poorest
countries are beginning to prove them wrong, as fertility rates drop faster
than predicted toward the replacement level - 2.1 children for the average
mother, one baby to replace each parent, plus a fraction to compensate for
unexpected deaths in the overall population.

A few decades ago in certain countries like Brazil, Egypt, India and Mexico
fertility rates were as high as five or six.

As a result, United Nations demographers who once predicted the earth's
population would peak at 12 billion over the next century or two are
scaling back their estimates. Instead, they cautiously predict, the world's
population will peak at 10 billion before 2200, when it may begin declining.

Some experts are wary of too much optimism, however. At the Population
Council, an independent research organization in New York, Dr. John
Bongaarts has studied population declines in various countries over the
last half century. He questions the assumption that when fertility declines
begin they will continue to go down at the same pace, especially if good
family planning services are not widely available.

Sharp fertility declines in many industrialized and middle-income countries
had already challenged another old belief: that culture and religion would
thwart efforts to cut fertility. In Italy, a Roman Catholic country whose
big families were the stuff of cinema, family size is shrinking faster than
anywhere else in Europe, and the population is aging rapidly as fewer
children are born. Islamic Iran has also had great success with family
planning.

""Projections aren't terribly accurate over the long haul,"" said Dr.
Nicholas Eberstadt, a demography expert at the American Enterprise
Institute in Washington. ""Demographers have been surprised by just about
every big fertility change in the modern period. Demographers didn't
anticipate the baby boom. They did not anticipate the subsequent decline in
fertility in industrialized Western democracies.""

What's next? Demographers can agree generally on a few measurable facts and
some trends. The world's population, now 6.2 billion, quadrupled in the
20th century, and changed in drastic ways. In 1900, 86 percent of the
world's people lived in rural areas and about 14 percent in urban areas. By
2000, urban communities were home to 47 percent of the population, with 53
percent still in the countryside.

Between now and 2030, when the global population is expected to reach about
eight billion, almost all the growth will be in cities. But urbanization is
not necessarily a bad thing for the environment, said Dr. Joseph Chamie,
director of the United Nations' population division.

""Moving to cities frees up the land for forestry, agriculture and many
other activities,"" Dr. Chamie said. ""You're getting people concentrated, so
you can probably recycle more easily. People change their lifestyles. The
Indian moving from the boonies of Uttar Pradesh to the city of Lucknow gets
educational opportunities, cultural opportunities, all sorts of political
participation. He can be influenced by advertising and public relations
campaigns. Immunization will be better, and family planning.""

As births fall and lives are extended, the global population is getting
older. The over-80 age group is the fastest growing.

But not everywhere. For example, the United Nations calculates that life
expectancy at birth is being slashed in countries hardest hit by AIDS. In
South Africa, the life of a baby born now should be 66 years; AIDS has cut
that to 47. In Zimbabwe, the drop has been to 43 years from 69. In
Botswana, it is 36 years, down from 70.

Another cautionary sign from projections is that where populations are
continuing to grow fastest, societies and governments may be least likely
to cope with the results, including strains on natural resources -
farmland, water, air, forests and animals.

Last year, the organization published a report and wall chart, ""Population,
Environment and Development,"" plotting and analyzing population changes as
its contribution to the debate surrounding the Johannesburg summit meeting.

The United Nations estimates that the world's current population, 6.2
billion, is growing at an annual rate slightly over 1.2 percent, producing
some 77 million people. Of this growth, 97 percent is taking place in
less-developed countries, said Dr. Chamie, whose position at the United
Nations makes him chief keeper of the world's statistics. Six nations will
dominate this growth, and in this order: India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria,
Bangladesh and Indonesia.

Thus, though fertility is declining unexpectedly in a poor country like
India, which has more than a billion people, the actual numbers continue to
rise rapidly because the base is so large. India is gaining as many people
annually as China, Pakistan and Nigeria combined, the United Nations says.

India is projected to have at least 100 million more people than China by
2050, even if China's one-child policy is relaxed. Small families are now
the norm for the Chinese, whose standard of living has risen above that of
the people of India by many measures.

Among industrialized countries, the United States alone has a growth rate
comparable to that of developing nations. It now ranks seventh in growth,
Dr. Chamie said, but 80 percent of that growth comes from immigration. In
Europe, populations are shrinking, even with more immigration.

With much of the population bulge predicted in Asia, the East-West Center
in Honolulu has just published a report, ""The Future of Population in
Asia,"" which finds cause to fear considerable environmental stress in a
region where population densities and numbers are often great. Asia, the
report notes, already has 56 percent of the world's population living on 31
percent of its arable land, and more than 900 million people exist on less
than $1 a day.

""Asia faces the most acute pressure on arable agricultural land of any
region in the world,"" the report says, adding that expansion of farmland
has been made at the cost of forests. Acute water scarcity, a significant
loss of biodiversity and more urban pollution seem inevitable. Twelve of
the world's 15 most polluted cities are in Asia. By 2020, the report
predicts, Asia will be producing more carbon dioxide emissions than any
other region.

""When looking at current and future environmental concerns in Asia,"" the
report concludes, ""the number of people to be fed, clothed, housed,
transported, educated and employed may not be the only issue, but it is an
issue that cannot be ignored.""

South Korea was a lot poorer after the Korean war than Ghana when it

We can lose billions of dollars, and have hundreds of thousands of 
people laid off... and after it all, our diets, health, longevity,

The Philippines suffers from a Spanish-imposed aristocratic landowner
class, the same as in most of Latin America, with the serf-like
relationships that go with it.  You have multiple generations of
peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a
human parts of the property package.

The problem in the Philippines is that the landowner class is fading,
but the peasants are still operating under the old economic assumption
even though it isn't being imposed on them in most cases.  In a number
of areas, you have landowners that don't use their lands during bad
years (i.e. when sugar prices fall too low or some other condition that
makes planting unprofitable in the global economy) and in some cases
have all but abandoned them, but when they come back to plant crops
several years later they find the same peasants living on the fallow
land as scratch farmers to survive and waiting for the landowner to come
back and give them something to do.

The government's solution to this was to ""redistribute"" fallow land to
the peasants that lived on them, and created a number of problems in the
process.  First of all, it meant that all the agricultural producers had
to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) or the government would
seize the land and give it to someone else, which is not economically
optimal by any means.  Second when they give it to the peasants, they
use it to become scratch farmers, which is not a particularly productive
economic activity, and the landowners generally let them do that for
free when the land is fallow anyway.  Third, the peasants generally
*prefer* to work for the landowner rather than own the land themselves;
they make more money, have more opportunities to become middle-class,
and enjoy a better lifestyle under that arrangement.  So the result of
all this is that the landowners either run an economically sub-optimal
agriculture business to protect their lands, or they risk having their
land seized without compensation and given to the peasants/squatters who
will gladly sell it back to the plantation owner rather than becoming
scratch farmers, another economically sub-optimal solution. The only
real role of the government in this arrangement is to be a drag on the
economy.

And I don't know about 20 years for land titles in the Philippines.  It
takes a little longer than in the US (though not much), and you may have
to bribe someone to make it work well in an expedited manner, but it
isn't that onerous in the regions I'm familiar with.

Speaking as a former Philippine plantation owner. (Yes, really. On
Negros and Cebu. Have I led a strange life or what?)

that you can't convert without an army of lawyers.

In other cases, you originally had owners who didn't have the 'right' to
subdivide, but they subdivide anyway.

It is interesting to note that for several centuries in Japan it was a
death sentence to sell land.  They sold it anyway, and kept records.

In the US, we eventually got quite friendly with squatters and adverse
possession, and integrated out extra-legal arrangements and 'spontaneous
social contracts' into the official law.

Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.

Socialism increases regulation which increases corruption.  But that
doesn't matter as much as if the official law does not conform to the
facts on the ground.

If you don't match the law to the facts on the ground, you wind up with
a two-tier society (De Soto's Bell Jar).  Worse, the massive evasion of
the official law encourages the corruption you speak of.

In some countries, the agencies in charge of registering property also
arrange for illegal living arrangements for their employees.  They do
this because even the people who run the system can't make it work for
people they care about.

				P2P getting down to some serious work
      	
 
    
	 By John Fontana
    Network World, 08/19/02
	
 



Just a few years removed from the mayhem of music swapping that clogged corporate networks, peer-to-peer technology is growing up and rediscovering its roots as a legitimate concept for distributed computing in corporate environments and the Internet.

The turnaround is distinct since P2P has distanced itself from the darling days of Napster and has been transplanted onto the architectural drawing boards of Internet and corporate network gurus.

For network executives, the about-face is showing up in such discrete places as wireless routing, identity management, Web services and grid computing. P2P has proved its worth - albeit with a few warts - in enterprise collaboration and content management applications, but its brightest future may be in the plumbing of corporate distributed computing.
 

But even as P2P fades into the background, questions around security, standards and quality of service still have to be answered before P2P can flourish, experts say.
The P2P evolution

Regardless, P2P's evolution has hit its next stage. 

""Peer-to-peer is an architecture and one that will play a substantial role in distributed computing as endpoints in the network gain more power,"" says Jamie Lewis, CEO and research chair of Burton Group. He says that will be particularly important for Web services as peers share processes and data. ""P2P will become a fundamental part of how distributed computing evolves across the Internet and how enterprises build distributed systems internally."" 

Lewis says the Internet today is very rudimentary with its basic protocols for basic operations. ""Now we're seriously talking about the network becoming the computer, incorporating some P2P connections and being able to share processes and power, which is what grid computing provides.""

Observers say it's a renaissance.

""P2P's reverting to an architecture that can be applied to solve problems that by their very nature are distributed,"" says Neil Macehiter, senior consultant for Ovum, a research and consulting firm. ""But the question is can this model provide benefits for business use.""

Macehiter says it can, but he cautions that security, such as removing blocks to P2P traffic on corporate firewalls, is still a major inhibitor to acceptance. 

""But you can imagine something like grid extending to share application logic instead of just being a data grid or a storage grid. When you look at Web services sharing business logic in the enterprise, you see the intersection with grid and P2P,"" he says.
Working together

To underscore P2P's evolution, the Global Grid Forum (GGF), a 2-year-old group founded by academics and researches, merged in April with the P2P Working Group, originally founded by Intel. The groups are attempting to marry the GGF's work on harnessing servers on a grid with P2P's ability to connect desktops.

""We're now trying to figure out how grid and P2P play nice together, and capture that power for use in enterprise computing,"" says Andrew Chien, co-director of the GGF's peer-to-peer area and CTO of Entropia, a provider of desktop grid applications.

Late last month, the merged group began evaluating how P2P relates to the Open Grid Services Architecture, an effort to standardize grid computing. Chien says his group is exploring how P2P protocols for such things as registration, resource discovery and coordination of data transfer support a common grid infrastructure.

And P2P's roots are reaching into other areas. It is an integral part of mobile wireless technology set for release this fall by MeshNetworks. The company's MeshLAN software extends the range of 802.11 wireless networks by making every wireless peer an endpoint in an ad-hoc P2P network and also a router/repeater to channel traffic to other peers.

Using a patented multihopping technology, peers that are out of range of wireless access points or peers they wish to communicate with can hop through other peers to reach their destination, including corporate LANs. It not only increases the wireless range, it preserves throughput, which is up to 6 megabits. The technology also is mobile, letting hopping take place from nodes traveling in vehicles up to 250 mph.

""P2P allows us to do the hopping, and our algorithms allow the traffic to pick the most efficient path to travel,"" says Rick Rotondo, vice president of disruptive technologies for MeshNetworks. ""The beauty of a P2P network is that it is self-forming and self-healing.""

And the technology is mature.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which created the Internet, spent $150 million developing the peer technology for use in forming instant networks among soldiers on a battlefield. MeshNetworks licensed it from DARPA has spent an additional $27 million to create a commercial product.

P2P also is key to the PingID Project to create an identity management system similar to work under way by Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance Project, which are not using P2P. 

""Ideally, you need a way to create, manage and exchange digital identity information with no one in the middle of the transaction,"" says Andre Duran, founder of the project. He says that's P2P, but it's just one part of the equation. 

""Your ID is a virtual private vault with different drawers,"" Duran says. ""One drawer may be on your PC, one may be with a service provider, and you need a client to manage all that. We are building the infrastructure to support that.""

Ping ID is working on server and client software that acts like a mini-Web server and maintains a repository of user's identity information. Users have the option of exchanging IDs directly through P2P or using client/server technology to authorize a third party to dispense their identity data. 

""P2P provides a level of control that other architectures don't,"" Duran says. ""It comes down to the fact that some applications are more efficient with P2P.""

That is the concept that is driving P2P into so many different areas of computing.

""P2P has evolved from something highly disruptive to something complementary to intranets, extranets, mobile users and all the Web integration,"" says Greg Bolcer, CTO of Endeavors Technology, which develops a P2P collaboration software called Magi.

And although P2P is still settling into this new role, it's obvious that its reputation as a music-swapping corporate scourge are now well behind it.

the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards,kragen@pobox.com,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Thu, 22 Aug 2002 00:24:54 -0400","On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,
which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
anyone else.

If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.

At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
--- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
vulnerability, if possible.  

This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
was.

The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
underground, vulnerable.

The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
long as possible.

iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  

Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
information.

If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
together, add up to a catastrophe.

First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.

Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
--- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.

I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.

I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
are good at networked theft may not yet exist.

There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
Samba, for example.

Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
increase the availability of that information to the people who can
afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.

Let's not let that happen.

Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program


Greetings,

iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.

iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
provides answers to some basic questions about the program:

Q. How will it work?
A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
of motivations, including the following:

         * Pure love of security research
         * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
         * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
         * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure

The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
items:

         * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)
         * The amount of detail and analysis provided
         * The potential severity level for the information shared
         * The types of applications, operating systems, and other
           software and hardware potentially affected
         * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs
         * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE

Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?
A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other
entity.

Q. Why are you launching this program?
A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions
to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More
often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the
original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is
compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the
public at large are warned in a timely manner.

Q. Who gets the credit?
A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or
exploit information.

Q. When can I contribute?
The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.

To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have
questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please
contact us at contributor@idefense.com.

i took a look into the repository it ""just"" contains gstreamer and his dependecies
but thats nice for people who use it though :)

thanks,
che

personally i am capped to 16 kb/s upstream only :\ if i just had like 10 to 20 times of that i would run a repository for sure. i guess alot of people would love to even get daily builds (yes i know i deserve to be eaten for that idea because it would need alot of bandwidth) but well would still be nice :).

well in my eyes something like a public contrib repository would be nice (where everyone can at least upload spec files) and a something like a ""repository directory"" with a collection of available repositorys and their content.

i am personally on a dsl dialup connection with 16kb/s upstream cap and that kinda sucks perhaps i am gonna still create a respository for small windowmaker dockapps in the future :).

what do you think?

Sure, just use ""os"" and ""updates"" from apt.freshrpms.net for instance then
add the lines for that repository with only the module you want/need (here
it's ""testing73"" I guess).

    Yeah, I'm one of them.  Ximian, if it could be installed from Apt would be sweet- the graphics are done very, very well.  The usability is actually higher than most other environments.  But their installer really sucks.

    If you find/setup one (and figure out how to install it) let me know.

I got that with the earlier URL. Those that say 73/72 at the end work,
though.

I just installed gnome-terminal and I'm impressed by that. I have seom
gtk1 apps to rebuild and put into my own repository (like gaim) so I
didn't do the full session install. Besides, it's HUGE. And it wants to
install stuff like kudzu and parted and who knows what. What's wrong
with dynamic configuration? Dependency hell indeed.

Apparently, yes. Though for me it did suggest all sorts of creepy stuff.
After installing packages one by one and removing some old stuff and
whatnot, the original gnome-session from there suddenly no longer
wanted parted and all that. Go figure.

> Also Gaim doesn't work with GNOME 2.0 just yet?

If you strip out the gnome stuff, it still runs as a Gtk app without the
applet. Maybe you can even leave in the old panel and all that but I
think some files will conflict and have to be overridden with
--replace-files (dangerous). I just rebuilt gaim and made a few changes
to the .spec adding --without-gnome to %configure or such. It might be
nice to separate the panel version from the actual program like debian
does.

Also, bubblemon no longer compiled for me and Yelp had some broken
dependency there.

    Does it work more than once?

    Failed to fetch http://apt.sunnmore.net/gnome2/filename-here.rpm

    Server problems? Or is this a way to limit bandwidth?

    I was thinkinf about an addition of another file: apt-repositories. Stick it on apt.freshmeat.net (the center of the apt universe, IMHO) and every time a new repository is added, the RPM can be rebuilt.  Heck, if I could get out of my depression, I could make the whole submission process automated....even making the RPM...

Well, I already keep a list of known apt repositories on
http://freshrpms.net/apt/ although I haven't added the ones that were
talked about lately (actually I've been very busy over the week-end and I'm

I'm uising Havoc Pennington's Gnomehide and it rocks. I installed it before I
knew about apt, but one of the previous emails had an apt repository that
claimed to have gnomehide. Just remember there is one kew file that makes the
difference between Gnome1 and Gnome2 being used. I *think* it is ""gnome-core""
vs. ""gnome-session"" but I can not remember.

Note that that those same files are probably in the Limbo beta, except
updated. There has not been a major change to ""gnomehide"" in a while, I
suspect Havoc's work went into Limbo then.

Right, gnomehide is only updated when it's been a while since the last
red hat release, and the next beta isn't out yet. Since the beta is out
now, gnomehide won't be updated again for a while.

I think that's simply because Sylpheed isn't a GNOME application, but a
""simple"" gtk+ one. It needs no GNOME libs at all, so upgrading to GNOME 2
but keeping gtk+ 1.2 will let you keep Sylpheed with no problem.

    Yeah, mine works here; I did about the same thing.

    Hey: ""Universe""   I saw this keyword on the gstreamer website.  They said something like ""If you're feeling froggy and want to jump into it, use apt-get gstreamer-universe"" but I've not gotten the syntax of it right, to get ""all"" of a project yet.  Has anyone used this yet?

This is called ""pseudo-packages"" or ""meta-packages"" and Debian has been
using them for ages. I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty
packages.

Anyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally
although I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like
them. For me it's more of an ugly ""hack"" than anything else, and I'd
approve completely a system that would enable to install/remove entire
categories of software... but not if achieved by building empty packages.

Also, you can trivially do ""apt-get install <metapackage>"", but removing
all that it installed is a bit less trivial, and could be implemented in a
trivial and clean fashion if using some functionality meant to do this.

Maybe sf.net should provide automated (how much more automated can it
get? Well, maybe automatic one-click setup and instructions for those
who can't read manuals and a place in which to drop gpg keys) apt-rpm
(and maybe apt-deb though debian seems to package most stuff anyway)
repositories. If it was one big repository for ""stable"" releases and
each could have their own for ""development"" or ""testing"" releases. You
handled your own repo and they did a nightly stable update for example.
Also it should check that no-one can manage to put in a package with the
same name as another one or otherwise sabotage the thing.

(hmm, and I suppose the good sigmonster may deserve a cookie, too..)

    Yeah, well, I'm about to chuck the whole darned thing right now: the first upgrade to Gnome2 wiped out the possibility of changing preferences...exactly what got me outta Ximian before.  I understand Gnomehide has the same files, right?  I'm thinking about excorsizing the durned Ximian again...

    Nope- this one's all about gnome-vfs2 and the developers understand each other's parts- it's a programming issues.  Some versions work together, some don't.  Just like rep-gtk and audiofile was for sawfish, in the previous version of Ximian-gnome.  :(

    Yeah...That's why I was hoping someone else had a 'more gospel' set of files.  Oh, well.  I've found a URL on my system I can get to'em with Nautilus.

Re: Gstreamer update,Lance <lance_tt@bellsouth.net>,rpm-zzzlist@freshrpms.net,"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 20:22:27 -0500","Well, I tried the Ximian GNOME 2.0 packages from
http://apt.sunnmore.net, and have to say, it was a let-down.  Ran
'apt-get update' , 'apt-get install gnome-session' then 'apt-get
upgrade' and Nautilus failed to execute, couldn't get any help docs to
come up, along with more problems.  So, with the luck of 'rpm -qa|grep
ximian' then removing by hand all ximian packages with 'rpm -e --nodeps'
and reinstalling everything GNOME and GNOME-related with apt, I got
trusty old Red Hat 7.3 GNOME back on the desktop, and the only trace of
Ximian is Evolution, again, thanks to apt from this site.

I really liked Ximian (back then, Helix ?) at first but, to me, Red
Hat's GNOME, released with 7.3 seems much more pretty and up-to-date. 
Could this be because of inclusion of gtk2 in RH 7.3?

Not many apps actually use gtk2 yet. If they do, it's obvious because it is a
different tool kit. With gnomehide, I ported a lot of gtk1.2 themes to gtk2,
because they are rarely compatible. Those themes are on dudex.net/rpms/ but it
does not matter unless you have gnome2.

In gnomehide, the apps that actually use gtk2 are Nautilus, gedit, some of the
""utility"" apps, like dictionary, calcultor, the settings applets, and of
course the gnome panels and menus.

Take a look at <http://cachalot.ods.org/>, I have RPMs for RH7.3 there,
based on (and compatible with) the NH3.x that last appeared in RH7.1

Well, you can simply use an rpm tarball (or extract one from a source rpm
on a machine that has rpm scripts install ""rpm2cpio <file.src.rpm> | cpio
-dimv"" and ""./configure && make && make install"" as usual. You need db3 or
db4 development files at least, and once everything installed you'll need
to initialize your rpm database.

If you need more help, I suggest you join the rpm-list@redhat.com by
subscribing at https://listman.redhat.com/

    Well, if you have a Windows, SCO, or AIX box, (generally anything BUT Redhat Linux) that'd be the site I'd send you to, to get it installed.  I've been there for the same reason, under SCO.  Maybe you missed something?

The X server itself does (or does not, depending on your driver). There
is a software fallback called Mesa compiled in the X server, which
is used as a fallback. So, if you have installed X, you have OpenGL.
Try the glxinfo command to see the capabilities provided by your
X system.

If you have an NVIDIA card, the NVIDIA_GLX rpm provides OpenGL. It's for
the NVidia proprietory drivers.

So, I *do* have OpenGL, thanks all.

Problem is that I can't find an rpm of plib which will install (or recognise 
that I have open GL). I guess I'll have to try and do that from source, 
unless anyone has any ideas?

For that n°2, it's simple : They've been pulled out from the upstream xine
source. I guess I should make a ""xine-skins"" package if there is enough
demand for it ;-)

Well, replying to my own post, sorry ;-)
There is now a 1.3MB xine-skins package that includes all the available
skins that can be found on the xine website.

Time to ""apt-get install xine-skins"" for those who started to miss xinetic
or lcd ;-)

Take a look at
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jpackage/website/htdocs/functions.php?rev=1.6&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup>, that's what produces the list at <http://jpackage.sourceforge.net/packages.php>.  Dirs are sorted alphabetically there, but I guess sorting by date wouldn't be that hairy...

You could try opening the directory with $filelist = popen(""ls -t
<path/to/dir>"", ""r""). This should give you the filenames in the
directory sorted by mod.time. You can then open each filename, and read
filemtime() to get the mod.time.

    Yep.  Make sure there's a field in the database called (for example) ""Updated"" and when it comes time to generate the list, add ""order by updated"".  This'll put it in that particular order for ya.  You can also chose to order it by name, etc by changing this field.

    This should be the same for both MySql and Postgressql (any modern SQL, really).  Which are you using?

None for that ""builds"" part : It's just an export of the CVS tree in which
I keep my spec files and patches! ;-)
I think the filemtime() php function that Ville uses in his sript is what
I'm looking for, then I guess I just need to fill an array with the names
and mtimes, sort it, then display what I want :-)

Please! It does seem that with 7.3 something rather extraordinary has 
happened! And while there are rpms for plib (as in plib.sf.net), TuxRacer, 
FlightGear and so on (for SuSE, Mandy and Connectiva, IIRC) dotted around, 
there are none for 7.3.

    Yeah, I know what you mean.  Here's the trick:

    Remove the Nvidia drivers. Yeah, I know it's a pain...
    Load BOTH mesa, mesa-demos and basically everything that comes in the mesa rpm.   
    THEN load NVidia; it'll know what to do.

    ...but it seems like I had to do this on 7.2, too.

I'm currently running RawHide, since I had the brilliant idea that, by
using APT, it might actually be practical to keep up with the
developments.

However, APT seems to want a recompile - its sometimes leaving the RPM
database in need of a db_recover - and gcc 3.2 seems to require a closer
adherence to the standard than the C++ in APT was written for.

This is a bit of a bummer.

Does anyone know if there's a latest version I could try which might
work, or whether I should simply do the porting myself? (I've made a
start, but there's a fair amount of work to do.)

If this works out, I might start a repository for the freshrpms compiled
on vLatest RawHide, for my own purposes and anyone else who's
interested.

Dave.

    Ya know, I was thinking the same thing.  But there's at least two main 'opposing thumbs' between regedit and gconf:

    1. GConf is written in English, not symbol tables; you can actually READ what the heck you're looking at.

    2. Because it's better-considered, it should be more sound; when the registry gets a wrong value, you may not be able to boot....if GConf is scrogged, you can still have all the underlying power of the OS to keep things running....just call up WindowMaker (or whatever) for the next session until you get it worked out.

    It took me a while to warm up to it...but I *do* like Gconf...

The thing is, I hadn't used gconf-editor yet... and it's exactly what I

""Chesapeake Skipjacks"" are a class of boats:

One of the things you need to understand with gnome2 is that while they
did simplify a lot of things, most of the configuration options people
found very useful are still available through gconf. Learn to love
gconf-editor ;) -- metacity can have sloppy focus (Desktop Preferences
-> Window Focus -- there's actually GUI for that), and the delay until
raising (and whether it raises) can be set in gconf-editor,

Well, it definitely is not the same as 1.4. Some people will always like
gnome 1 better. Whatever suits your needs.

I think you need to understand that simplifying the configuration
options and the UI does make it a lot easier to use for people who are
either not using it all the time or are just starting to use it. The
GNOME team decided that advanced users who want to edit the kinds of
options you talk about are advanced enough to use gconf-editor.
Personally, I'm fine with that, because I don't find gconf-editor hard
to use :)

More like Apple's implementation - the Gconf2 files are bog-standard 
XML, should you feel tempted to edit it by hand :)

There are some possibilities that using standardised configuration tools 
provide: the ability to centrally manage a large number of computers - 
something like Windows' group policy. Although that would require other 
applications to use GConf as well .

Haven't installed Limbo beta2 myself - been sidetracked by work; the 
fact that the computer I'm installing it on is connected to a dodgy USB 
ADSL modem that requires heavy kernel patching means that I would have 
to do it over a weekend - but I don't think Red Hat currently does it 
for its config tools.

Michel

I honestly have no idea, and this is probably not the best list to expect

Indeed, I had repackaged a first version, but without fam support (not
released). I'll release the package with fam support right now ;-)

The current version of the Limbo beta is 7.3.93 (yeah, they should
have renamed it, but they didn't). It's in the same
redhat/linux/beta/limbo directory on the ftp servers. Just check the
redhat-release package to find out which version is on the server. 
Looking at ftp.redhat.com, the current one is redhat-release-7.3.93-2.

If you're using GNOME2 from the beta, I'd upgrade as there were some
important bugfixes since the first beta. The only thing to watch out
for is that Limbo2 switched gcc to 3.2, which is once again
incompatible with the previous gcc (v3.1 shipped in Limbo1).

Actually, I've already rebuild gnuboy, I just had forgotten to commit the
spec file, which is now done :

http://freshrpms.net/builds/gnuboy/gnuboy.spec

Basically, %doc is used to put files in %docdir (default to
/usr/share/docs/%{name}-%{version}/ and the listed files with relative
paths (i.e. that don't start with a ""/"") are relative to the %{builddir}
(the uncompressed source usually). So either you can choose to have a
""docs"" directory inside %{_docdir} by putting :
%doc docs
(or, totally equivalent, the latter just reminding it's a directory)
%doc docs/
Or you can put all files that are in docs/ directly in %{_docdir} :
%doc docs/*

Try both, poke around, and you should catch the difference if it's not
already clear for you.
You can also mark any file from the %{buildroot} as documentation (will be
listed when using ""-qd"" to query the package's docs) by using %doc with
absolute filenames, for example :
%doc %{_datadir}/foo-game/manual
(this is /usr/share/foo-game/manual, an absolute file)
Also, for the packager's convenience, all files in /usr/share/man (aka
%{_mandir}) are automatically tagged as %doc.

Build the package once and see if it checks for a specific version, or read
the installation notes. Often you'll see ""checking for SDL >= 1.2.0"" for
example when running configure, then it's best to also make the package
depend on that version.

Well, read the docs indeed :-) You can also compile the package once
without those fields and see what the configure script is checking for
(basically, the libs and versions you'll need to add to the BuildRequires:)
then once the package is built, query the automatic dependencies that rpm
put into it. You'll see for instance if the binaries/libs from the package
need SDL, gtk+  etc. Then add those ""Requires:"" and rebuild a final version
of the package.
Often you can omit some dependencies, for example if a program is checking
for glib, gtk+, gdk-pixbuf and gnome libraries when being compiled,
BuildRequires: gnome-libs-devel
Requires: gnome-libs
will be enough since they already depend on the ""lower level"" libs that are
glib, gtk+ and gdk-pixbuf.

Well, this is typically the type of information interesting to share with
others, so I'll copy this answer to the rpm-list hoping some people will
appreciate :-)

Eeeek... I hope they aren't intending to release a new RH with a new gcc
which hasn't yet been released (again). Bad enough the first time, and
I'm sure it gave RedHat a lot of embarrassment.

FWIW, I've yet to compile apt on the gcc 3.2 snapshot in RawHide - apt's
C++ makes several rather poor assumptions on what iterators are, and in
addition doesn't use namespaces at all.

For non-C++ folk, this basically means it needs porting. I've got a
reasonable way along, now, and I'll send a suitable patch to Connectiva
or somewhere when I succeed - I can't find anything on Connectiva's site
itself for this.

In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really
started on this, but it's mainly just arguments added. The rpmlib
documentation seems somewhat poor, though, unless I've missed it.

Dave.

There are already patches for this, look at the Conectiva apt-list
archives, you should find them there. Also, apt 0.5 is being actively
developed and already contains enough fixes to be compiled on Limbo with
gcc 3.2.

You can still use an apt package compiled on Red Hat Linux 7.3 as long as
you install the ""rpm404"" package for compatibility. That's what I'm doing
currently on my home Rawhide system.

xine problems,Nick Verhaegen <nick@permflux.org>,rpm-zzzlist@freshrpms.net,"Tue, 13 Aug 2002 21:45:51 +0200","Hi,

	I'm no longer able to play encrypted dvd's using the xine rpm from freshrpms. 
I think it was about a week ago when I last rented some dvd's, worked just 
fine, but apparently since the latest xine update on freshrpms, it won't 
anymore. 
The output is :

input_dvd: Sorry, this plugin doesn't play encrypted DVDs. The legal status
           of CSS decryption is unclear and we can't provide such code.
           Please check http://dvd.sf.net for more information.

I'm pretty sure it worked with the previous freshrpms release... Any way of 
rolling back updates ?

%description
    SpamAssassin provides you with a way to reduce if not completely
eliminate
    Unsolicited Commercial Email (SPAM) from your incoming email.  It can
    be invoked by a MDA such as sendmail or postfix, or can be called from
    a procmail script, .forward file, etc.  It uses a genetic-algorithm
    evolved scoring system to identify messages which look spammy, then
    adds headers to the message so they can be filtered by the user's mail
    reading software.  This distribution includes the spamd/spamc components
    which create a server that considerably speeds processing of mail.

I'm decoding this to mean:

""This spec file installs in the system, rather than in the build root,
even though I am passing the relevant overrides to make. It is as if the
Makefile does not allow overrides, or does not have those variables.""

I note that:

1) It's one of those Makefile.PL things.
2) While I know that Makefiles generated by a ./configure generated in
turn by a later version of auto* do support the technique you're trying,
I know nothing about what the Perl MakeMaker (or whatever it is)
supports.

The general solution for cases like this is to install manually (Try
make -n and see what it does). I think that Perl's installer system
might support an installation root, though I've blissfully no idea how
to operate it.

I suggest finding a small Perl module SRPM and looking at the spec file
to see how RedHat (or Turbo, or PLD, although RedHat generally know
*all* the tricks) do it.

Dave.

I had to take a stab at answering that for a paying customer yesterday.
I _think_ you need to install postgreql-odbc and its' dependencies. Then
probably a bit of configuration to open a port to the network. But
Matthias is right, this is not the right place for this question.

To bring things back on topic, I was practicing my ""rpmbuild'n skillz""
and made an rpm with some simple software tools to drive my DVD+RW
burner. No GUI frontend, but it works just fine from the command line. I
even used it to burn a bootable DVD version of Red Hat 7.3.

Well, first you need to look at the Makefile.PL to see if it uses the
PREFIX you're trying to pass to it or not. Maybe you'll need to ""override""
other paths when doing the ""make"".
Second, the ""%makeinstall"" macro automatically overrides many common values
like ""prefix="" or ""datadir="", so it's completely redundant with the
""PREFIX="" you're passing to it. Take a look at the ""Makefile"" you have at
that point to see how the ""install"" target is, and what it uses.

Last, as Chris suggested, you can take a look at an existing package, like
the one in Rawhide ;-)

If you get this message, it means that you're using the ""DVD"" button, which
is the default DVD plugin and doesn't support decryption. You should either
use the ""d4d"" one (no menus) or ""d5d"" (with menus).

Nice! :-)
What about the ""dvdrecord"" package that's already included in 7.3? It
doesn't do what this one does? I'm asking this because I've got a friend
with an iMac running YellowDog Linux (basically Red Hat Linux for PPC), and
it's one of the newer versions with a DVD burner. I'd be very interested in
using his drive to burn DVDs full of 2-CDs movies or full of ""files for
xmame"" ;-)
Also, a bootable DVD of Red Hat Linux 7.3 would be great as I've still not
burned the CDs even once for myself since I always install through the
network (and haven't found an easy way of purchasing an english boxed set
here in Spain...).

That's done by bero - not too sure whether it works on
DVD+RW drives, I believe it supports only DVD-R.

Would be nice to have a unified tool for DVD/CD
burning - already I do my CD burning from dvdrecord
since it is more recent.

No, they do not (what would be the use of that, anyway?). They say that
they will _try_ to eval macros even if the user forgot to pass the
leading '%', but that this feature should not be relied upon.

Hmm.  1. The quote is not suggesting that people use './configure'.
2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even
if the user forgot to pass the leading '%'.  It is saying the opposite:
rpm will try to support users who ""forgot"" to _leave off_ the leading
'%'.  That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow
the documentation.  If you leave off the '%', then rpm will not eval
the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4.

Confused?

Anyway, back to my original problem: what about documentation for
the macros '%post', '%postun', and '%files'?  Here's some of what
I found ""documented"" in the the CHANGES file that 'rpm' includes:

Line 46:
	- macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config
only.

Line 49:
	- bail on %files macro.

Hmm.  So, there is no %files macro?

Line 172-174:
	- add ""rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)"" to track
	    %post -p ""/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib""
	  incompatibilities.

I'm unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it
appears to work just the same.  The important things to remember are:

  1. Don't forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string.  If
     you leave them off, you'll get the cryptic error message:

     error: line #: Package does not exist: %post -p /sbin/ldconfig -n
/usr/lib

  2. This only works with RPM 4.0.3 or later.

    I'm in your same shoes- I can get it upgraded and all, but I can never seem to work out where to start out with the thing; it strikes me as confusing!  But to be fair, I appreciate the pipline idea; just as it's useful on the commandline, it'll be emensely powerful for manipulating multimedia, too.    It's just not EASY yet.  I'm sure all kindsa glade-produced front-ends will come up for it soon, though.  And the docs are complete, too...

Documentation about RPM macros?,"""Harig, Mark A."" <maharig@idirect.net>",rpm-zzzlist@freshrpms.net,"Wed, 14 Aug 2002 18:46:22 -0400","Hi,

   Can someone tell me where I can find some

I've been using the gstreamer repository with Rawhide Gnome 2 for the
last month or so with no problems. Even the new rhythmbox works (if
you can call taking 5 minutes to load my mp3 directory ""working"").

It might be something with Ximian's Gnome 2 snaps. AFAIK, they're 
pretty much straight out of CVS and hence a lot more experimental than 
some of the other Gnome 2 packages out there.

Actually it is (sort of).
To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once
the %files error was corrected :

rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit <specfile>

This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course,
you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_
produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able
to finish successfully.

Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because
entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really
installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're
writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-)

It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables
during install, when the simple cases like ""%makeinstall"" or ""make install
DESTDIR=%{buildroot}"" don't work. It keeps you from redoing all the
unpacking and building processes.

The checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I

As far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's 
not a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with 
full certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local 
use by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above 
technique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for 
everything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This 
just makes it a little bit faster.

That *.ss file is really a tar file, I had to use the linCVS pre-compiled binary
from their ESP install thingie because the one I compiled on my RH box would not run
on as many systems. The guy said something like this: ""it's an evil binary that only
runs on one system"", so I took the hint :)

NOTE: I think I understand why RPM makes you go thru the whole build process: prep,
patch, build, install, package ... there are ways to get around this, but the
package would not be ""from pristine sources"" so to speak. I read that the 1st big
change they made to RPM was to always use ""pristine"" sources, then have prep apply
the packager's patches; whereas the early RPMS were already RH patched, apparently,
not having the ""pristine"" sources as the author had released them.

Just a guess ... ???

No, the 7.3 dvdrtools works with DVD-R and DVD-RW, this package works
with DVD+R and DVD+RW. (Confused yet?) Unfortuantely these tools don't
have a gui frontend, but since the workhorse is a wrapper for mkisofs,
that shouldn't be too hard for someone who knows how to do those things.

Well that was an image I put together of just the first three disks of
the distro. Make it bootable too. Fun, but slower than a network
install.

Officially no. But also on my ftp://people.redhat.com/ckloiber page is
rpms for the rar-3.00 file archiving/unarchiving program. This is
distributed as a binary tarball only, and I repackaged it based
originally on an earlier version of rar I found on the net, just for
practice. It also makes use of subpackages, and I was both proud of
myself for getting it to work, and sickened that I repackaged
binary-only crap. Enjoy.

Well, the 7.3 binary should work as long as you install the ""rpm404"" (IIRC)
compatibility library. The only problem I have with some rpm 4.1 versions
is that it sometimes hangs at the and of operations (-e, -i, -F or -U) and
the only workaround is to kill it, ""rm -f /var/lib/rpm/__*"" and try again.

Well, you're lucky if it sometimes works for you.  Mine hang all the 
time, have to kill 'em with -9.  And after that, rpm doesn't work at all 
(hangs right after i run the command, prints nothing).  Have to reboot

After that ""kill -9"", removing the ""__*"" files in /var/lib/rpm/ and trying

One practice I've adopted is to list Requires: only when they're
absolutely necessary.  This will help because some packages are named
differently between distributions (eg. SDL <-> libSDL), and the
dependencies are automatically handled by RPM by depending on shared
library names.

This doesn't apply to BuildRequires: though.

Use macros for directory names where available, eg %{_libdir},
%{_bindir}, %{_datadir} etc.

I'd like to suggest using as many RPM macros for command names as
possible too, but unfortunately I don't know of a definitive reference
about them...

I have a small RedHat 7.3 RPM/apt repository at
<http://cachalot.ods.org/>, and I've received reports from people
running Mandrake 8.x and SuSE that the RPMs work with them out of the
box.

A lot of C++ programmers, myself included, were /not/ complaining about 
gcc's stricter adherence to the specification (which, by the way, a lot 
of kernel programmers complain about with gcc 3.x -- at least, the 
patch authors I've talked to hate gcc 3) -- gcc ""2.96"" had a lot of

Later ""versions"" of ""2.96"" fixed this, but it was well after 3.0 was

I just wanted to use 3.0, so I did.

Why not... it's just that sometimes it gets a bit more confusing in the
spec file since you have to change the ""Source:"" as well as ""%setup"" to
reflect the name changes. But it might also sometimes be even easier the
way you suggest, if the entire package contains only references to the
final version and that only the archive name has a ""pr1"" or ""beta6"" in it
for example.

Take for instance xmame : I've been packaging 0.61 pre-releases as
""0.61-fr0.x"" since the entire source has only ""0.61"" tags everywhere, no
preversion tags whatsoever.

Still, I don't think ""Epoch:"" is an evil hack although it's true that it
may cause problems between distributions when used. Wanting to avoid it
when possible is a good thing indeed ;-)

This works when you are defining a switch that %configure
does not already define, but how can we override an
existing switch?  For example,

  prefix: /usr/local

  %configure --prefix=%{?_prefix:%{prefix}}

would be desirable for making a .rpm package relocatable,
but this doesn't work.  'configure' receives two switches,
the default '--prefix=/usr' and the (attempted) override
'--prefix=/usr/local', but it only recognizes the first one.

Well, %configure doesn't define ""--program-prefix="", so that's why it
works. Maybe you thought that was an example, but no, it's the exact syntax
to use as a workaround ;-)

Ahhh ... this is funny. Last night I upgraded to Limbo II (.93).

Installed Limbo II kernel, Installed libstdc++ from rawhide (rpm -ivh) so the
newer apt would work, told apt it is OK to have multiple of libstdc++, copied
the actual rawhide ""libstdc++.so.5.0.0"" file to another directory, removed that
rawhide libstdc++ package, installed (rpm -ivh ) the Limbo II libstdc++ package
(new apt does not like it), make that symlink ""libstdc++.so.5"" point to that
rawhide file I moved earlier.

Apt works again, dump the Limbo II rpms into a dir, run the ""genaptrep.sh rh73"",
but ""topdir"" arg had changed, edit script, rerun, makes apt repository for Limbo
II. Do ""apt-get --ignore missing -f dist-upgrade"". Apt wants to uninstall itself
because that rawhide libstdc++ package is not installed, but apt works for the
moment because of that symlink I made.

Apt stays installed just long enough to issue the necessary ""dist-upgrade""
commands, several hours later, I have Limbo II, shiny and new. The install even
made that symlink point back to the correct libstdc++ file.

Several hours after that, I read my mail and realize that ""null"" directory I kept
seeing while downloading Limbo II was not a fluke.

Ahh, the joy. Repeat the above ....

Actually, I was hoping that you could answer the question ""how can we 
override an existing switch?""  For example, %configure uses the command-
line switch '--prefix'.  How can we override that value?

  %configure ???

You can just recompile the apt source RPM, if it's the newer one. (Such
as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.

Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box.
(Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production
boxes).

Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete ""old"" RPMS from a
directory containing both ""new"" and ""old"" RPMS? Say I have
blurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and
blurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remove the blurb-0.1.0-* because of
the presence of blurb-0.1.1-1? Anyone have a convenient script?

Dave.

Quite honestly, I thought that the last occurrence was the one that
counted. I'm almost sure I've already done something like :
%configure --bindir=%{_sbindir}
or even
%configure --sysconfdir=%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}

Are you sure that it was the first for you? Maybe you're forgetting to also
override it in %makeinstall like follows :
%makeinstall bindir=%{buildroot}%{_sbindir}
or even
%makeinstall sysconfdir=%{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}

Is that it?

Note also that there's hope of rpm being used on other systems than
Linux.
Look at
http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/linux/download.html

I think a good way to guess is to look at others' spec files, hardcode
as little as possible, replace abolute paths and commands with macros
if possible and accept and request patches and suggestions :)

This is a beta, probably of 8.0 although it's numbered 7.3.94. As such,
I've set up no apt repository for it, although you may find a few of my
packages recompiled for it under the /pub/freshrpms/null/ directory of my
ftp server.

    Ah; ok.  I'll wait.  I've got enough bugs to swat, but I really look forward to it.  Every version before now has seemed to have been bugfixes and meaningful upgrades of subtle stuff; I expect this one to be the ""no excuses to run Windows"" release to which I can point the unwashed hordes.

I agree.  In a way, I signed up just by buying steaks from them.  However, once
I tell them to stop, everything after that is spam.  I told them to stop *many*
times.

It's a pity, too, since they have great steaks.  Buying from them is just not
worth having to put up with all of that clinginess.

oops.  OK, now fixed; I've updated b2_4_0 to match what I wanted,
accordingly.  As a result, mass-checks do *NOT* need to be restarted as
the code and rules are the same as they were on HEAD.

cvs tag spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b

So, in full, here's the changes that are in spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b that
were not there before the branch:

  - rules fixed: HTTP_ESCAPED_HOST, HTTP_CTRL_CHARS_HOST.  they were too
    lax and caused FPs

  - Matt's faster HTML parser

  - commented rules un-commented again

  - a doco fix for spamd


and, for completeness, the relevant changes since Saturday:

  - the INSTALL file ;)

  - CALL_NOW now starts on a word boundary

  - Added examples to -R docs
  
  - Added Habeas HIL lookup

  - bug 385: spamcheck.py should handle 4xx errors -- full mailboxes etc.
    -- with EX_TEMPFAIL. patch from ckd-spamassassin@ckdhr.com
    (Christopher Davis) applied.

  -  made spamcheck.py use exit code 75 if it cannot connect to spamd,
     fixes bug 655

  - spamd/spamd.raw: fixed bug 704: spamd was not able to unlink pid file
    with -u arg

  - Makefile.PL: installing to random dirs now works fine

  - move MAILER_DAEMON into 70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf since it has been
    improved remove extraneous mass-check line for DATE_YEAR_ZERO_FIRST

  - spamassassin.raw: merged -Z with -D

  - removed eff.org from whitelists, as per Marc's request

  - mass-check: added versioning and date to mass-check output

  - bug 658: ok_locales set to 'en' by default. changed to 'all', users
    will have to customise for themselves.   Made many tests which trigger
    FPs on mail in ISO-2022-JP charsets, meta rules depending on
    __ISO_2022_JP_DELIM.

  - fixed phrase-freq code for vastly better performance

  - rules/50_scores.cf: changed LISTBUILDER score back to -5.0

  - lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: catch background images in uri code
    catch additional types of web bugs

  - rules/20_body_tests.cf: change CASHCASHCASH to meta rule to avoid
    Japanese false matches, revise spam phrases descriptions to be clearer
    (since a few are now basically compensation tests (please don't move
    them to the compensation file))

  - fixed bug in MIME_SUSPECT_NAME: text/plan attachments called foo.html
    were triggering.

  - revise HTML comment tests to use HTML parser

  - revise MAILER_DAEMON rule (get rid of some spam matches without losing
    any nonspam matches)

  - raise some negative scores that are way too low

  - remove ""Friend"" from DEAR_SOMETHING since it overlaps with DEAR_FRIEND
    and can match ""dear friend"" in middle of sentence too much

  - require ""Dear Friend"" to start the paragraph

  - add new HTML tests for font colors and faces, reduce number of
    different eval functions needed for HTML tests

Red Hat Network has determined that the following advisory is applicable to
one or more of the systems you have registered:

Complete information about this errata can be found at the following location:
     https://rhn.redhat.com/network/errata/errata_details.pxt?eid=1159

Security Advisory - RHSA-2002:158-09
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:
New kernel update available, fixes i810 video oops, several security issues

Updated kernel packages are now available which fix an oops in the i810 3D
kernel code. This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in
the dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security
holes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits.

Description:
The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that
were triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with
the Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger
race in the dcache of the file system subsystem.

This kernel update addresses both of these issues.

In addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following
drivers:

stradis
rio500
se401
usbvideo
apm

Finally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had
the capability to expose kernel memory when abused.

All of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the
time of this writing, have any known exploits.

We would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar
Designer, and others for their auditing work.

There're probably some problems with Justin's webserver; I'm shure he's

About this question: No, that's currently not possible. But I was thinking 
about implementing a feature like this; it might be in the next release.

 I don't really see the problem... either the whole message is unwanted spam
which you, one way or another, didn't agree to reciving, or it's something that
you, one way or another, said that you'd accept... If you said you'd accept it,
like mailinglists, then it isn't spam and shouldn't be caught as spam, no
matter if there's ads in it or not...

[SAtalk] Personal/Site-Wide SA Glitch (Spamassassin+Exim),Odhiambo Washington <wash@wananchi.com>,spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net,"Mon, 22 Jul 2002 17:57:26 +0300","Hello People,

I am new to SA but (2) problems I do have.

I run SA from my own home for personal use and it seems to work but I see this
in my procmail log:


<cut>
procmail: Executing "" ~/bin/SpamAssassin/spamassassin -P -c ~/bin/SpamAssassin/rules""
dccproc: not found
dccproc: not found
<cut>

Can someone enlighten me on why I get that? FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE, SA-2.3.0



Secondly, I've tested (now on Three boxes) SA for site-wide usage but I believe I am
missing something major because I've also had my setting checked/verified.

The problem is that the site-wide setup does NOT seem to work. Why?

1. I have my local.cf in /etc/mail/spamassassin
2. I have spamd running, and mail delivery logs show that all e-mails are
   being passed thro SA.

My local.cf contains:

ENABLED=1
OPTIONS=""-F 0""

#
rewrite_subject         0
report_header           1  
defang_mime             0
required_hits           7.0
report_header           1
use_terse_report        1
subject_tag             **SPAM**



wash ('tty') ~ 337 -> exim -bt engingwarez@runjiri.co.ke
eng.ngware@runji.co.ke
  deliver to enginngware in domain runjiri.co.ke
  director = spamcheck_director, transport = spamcheck


However when I check the mail delivered to this mailbox, SA has _not_ added any headers
to it.

PERTINENT: I also run a Virus Scanner called DRWEB via Exim's system filter and the rules
that I have applied are:

if not first_delivery or
    $received_protocol is ""drweb-scanned"" or
    $received_protocol is ""spam-scanned""
then
  finish
endif


Some enlightenment would bail me out, I believe.

Thanks

RE: [SAdev] Who uses Spam Assassin this way?,Michael Moncur <mgm@starlingtech.com>,"Marc Perkel <marc@perkel.com>, spamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net","Sun, 21 Jul 2002 20:24:22 -0600","I flag spam at 7.0 and drop it altogether at 20.0. I do lots of whitelisting
and have never had a false positive over 20.0.

Actually I save the 20-and-over spams to a file and occasionally
double-check it.

This allows me to keep over 75% of the spam out of my mailbox entirely - I
have 3-4 messages a day in my Spam folder instead of 20-30.

My system doesn't allow me to bounce messages with SA, but doing so doesn't
really get anybody removed from spam lists anyway... I have addresses that
have been bouncing for years that still get spam.

Real viruses are filtered before they reach any mailbox for delivery.

Tose two addresses could be accessible only for internal mail.

And as a user is using this mechanism to build his own database of
spam/non-spam, that's his problem is he sumbit something wrong.

BTW, same forgery or wrong submission problems would exist if each
user had his own set of 2 addresses.

It's pretty easy to figure out what matched if you write a short perl
script to match regular expressions or just use pcregrep (perl regular
expression grep).

 Not really, because you could use [user]-[action]-[passw]@domain.tld; instead
of letting 100'000 other users mess with your settings; not to mention virii
that randomly pick sendernames from addressbooks and the future virii that
target these ""not spam""-functions...

[VulnWatch] Advisory 02/2002: PHP remote vulnerability,e-matters Security <security@e-matters.de>,bugtraq@securityfocus.com,"Mon, 22 Jul 2002 13:21:28 +0200","                           e-matters GmbH
                          www.e-matters.de

                      -= Security  Advisory =-



     Advisory: Remote Compromise/DOS Vulnerability in PHP
 Release Date: 2002/07/22
Last Modified: 2002/07/22
       Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]

  Application: PHP 4.2.0, 4.2.1
     Severity: A vulnerability within the multipart/form-data handler
               could allow remote compromise of the web server.
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Patches Released.
    Reference: http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/022002.html



Overview:
	
   We have discovered a serious vulnerability within the default version 
   of PHP. Depending on the processor architecture it may be possible for a 
   remote attacker to either crash or compromise the web server. 
 
	
Details:

   PHP 4.2.0 introduced a completely rewritten multipart/form-data POST 
   handler. While I was working on the code in my role as PHP developer
   i found a bug within the way the mime headers are processed. 
   A malformed POST request can trigger an error condition, that is not
   correctly handled. Due to this bug it could happen that an uninit-
   ialised struct gets appended to the linked list of mime headers.
   When the lists gets cleaned or destroyed PHP tries to free the pointers
   that are expected in the struct. Because of the lack of initialisation
   those pointers contain stuff that was left on the stack by previous
   function calls. 

   On the IA32 architecture (aka. x86) it is not possible to control what
   will end up in the uninitialised struct because of the stack layout. All 
   possible code paths leave illegal addresses within the struct and PHP
   will crash when it tries to free them.

   Unfortunately the situation is absolutely different if you look on a
   solaris sparc installation. Here it is possible for an attacker to free
   chunks of memory that are full under his control. This is most probably
   the case for several more non IA32 architectures.

   Please note that exploitability is not only limited to systems that are
   running malloc()/free() implementations that are known to be vulnerable
   to control structure overwrites. This is because the internal PHP memory
   managment implements its own linked list system that can be used to
   overwrite nearly arbitrary memory addresses.
   

Proof of Concept:

   e-matters is not going to release the exploit for this vulnerability to
   the public.
   

Vendor Response:

   22th July 2002 - An updated version of PHP which fixes this 
                    vulnerability was released and can be downloaded at:

                       http://www.php.net/downloads.php

                    The vendor announcement is available at:

                       http://www.php.net/release_4_2_2.php


Recommendation:

   If you are running PHP 4.2.x you should upgrade as soon as possible,
   especially if your server runs on a non IA32 CPU. If you cannot upgrade
   for whatever reason the only way to workaround this, is to disable all
   kinds of POST requests on your server.

Those lines are technically *advertising*.

Spam is unsolicited bulk *EMAIL*.

A good time to savour again the classic Guardian interview from a couple of
years ago -
http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,365743,00.html

His tenants are 'filth'. People in council houses are 'worthless and lazy'.
Ramblers are 'nosy perverts'. Nicholas van Hoogstraten, a man who once paid
for a hand-grenade attack on a business rival, shows Emma Brockes around his
Sussex palace and explains why he's so keen to keep the riff-raff away

Friday September 8, 2000
...
On the way down from the roof, through the ""workers' quarters"" which Van
Hoogstraten intends to fill with staff from Zimbabwe, he returns to the
subject of peasants, expanding on the ""worthless"" and ""lazy"" majority who
make up the council estates of this country. ""You are playing up to your
villainous image,"" I suggest. Van Hoogstraten looks momentarily embarrassed.
""I'm not villainous,"" he mumbles. I ask if he regards the people who work
for him in these derogatory terms, and he says no, because they work hard
and hard labour is what distinguishes the ""riff-raff"" from the ""elite"". I
ask him if being a person of quality is merely a matter of wealth. He says
no, and refers to some of his wealthy neighbours, ""old-moneyed bastards""
whom he regards as being as primitive in their idleness as ""those rat bags
drawing social security.""

...
He was in the Bahamas when President John F Kennedy was shot, and amidst the
public mourning, remembers being pleased. ""I was glad,"" he says. ""He was
only in it for the ego trip."" He claims similar feelings on hearing news of
Diana's death, while returning from France on a ferry. ""She made us look
like fools,"" he says. ""She made a mockery of the royal family.""
Van Hoogstraten's relationship with authority is riddled with
contradictions. He says he hated Diana because she was thick, but when you
point out that the rest of the royal family are pretty thick too, he says
gloopily, ""they are all we've got, so we have to respect them."" He says he
favours dictatorship as the best form of government, but complains that some
of the officials he has dealt with in Mugabe's Zimbabwe are impossible
because ""the power has gone to their heads."" (Mugabe himself is the most
modest man he has ever met, he says, and he is friends with Ian Smith, who
apart from the small matter of his hysterical racism, he finds charming).
Margaret Thatcher is the only leader he has ever admired, because she made
him feel ""proud to be English"".
...

The 'van' is of course a late affectation - always an indication of a
genuine dickhead. See also Mohamed 'al' Fayed.

And maybe because there isn't an official 2.40 yet. It's 2.40-cvs and 
changes from day to day. Or, to cite the page [1]: ""these are built nightly 
from CVS. They may be unstable!"". One and a half good reason :o)

I have such a system.  It works like this :
    1)  sa-exim scans the message during the SMTP interaction
    2)  if it scores high enough it is rejected
        2.1)    if it is rejected, exim mentions that in the reject log
        2.2)    if it isn't rejected it is delivered
            2.2.1)  it is up to the user to deal with (filter as
                    desired) the lower-scoring spam
    3)  I have a script run as a daily cron job to run through the
        reject log and deposit a report in the user's home directory
        indicating what was rejected and way (SA isn't the only cause
        for rejection)

Obviously my setup is rather tied to exim and sa-exim, but if you want
the reporting script I can send it to you.

SpamAssassin here so that our users understand it.

I define ""Solicited Commercial Email"" vs ""Unsolicited Commercial Email"" -
the latter being SPAM. As SpamAssassin basically looks for ""Commercial
Email"", both get hit, and that's something they must understand.

Our SA documentation further tells users to filter off their SCE before
applying a SA rule - gets rid of 100% of the problem as the users know who
is sending them SCE.

So what brilliant metric do you have in mind to measure unsolicited vs.
solicited commercial email?

I know I've registered for many commercial lists that send material that
really reads like spam.  Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent
SA if they make spam look like this SCE.  This kind of convergence of the
two.... well, it stinks.  We can kill SCE, or we can cripple
identification of UCE.

Obviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably
harder.  What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc
is in the corpus for the GA?  Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set
of these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.

Yes, that is perfectly legitimate.  It is a math / accounting thing.
You get a paycheck for $100.  You get a bill for $20.  You add them
up.  Some of the additions are negitive debit amounts.  My bank
statement always has a long list of + items and - items.  If I can
keep the + items more than the - items I am doing good.

Frequency of messages does _not_ let you draw valid conclusions about the
understanding of the issues at hand of the sender.
IMHO it's sometimes even inversely proportional.

This should not impress you so much. At one time I even detected my name
on that page and I contributed less than a handful of rather simple rules.

That's not to say I don't appreciate Marc's contributions to the effort.
But in his place I would have (hopefully :) reevaluated my arguments in the
face of, as I saw it, massive rejection of his idea what constitutes spam.

Maybe this list can return to discussing technical topics. Politics should
go to spamassassin-talk.

[SAtalk] Sitewide Spam Filtering with Qmail ??,zenn <zenn@optushome.com.au>,spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net,"Wed, 24 Jul 2002 22:47:49 +1000","Hi all...

I'm new to SpamAssasin so I appologies if the question has been asked
before.
I'm thinking of setting up SA with my Qmail(Maildir) server acting as our
gateway.
It currently provides inline virus scanning and ORDB open relay filtering.
Is it possible to setup SA to act as a sitewide Spam filter ?
Is there any documentation on setting this up ?
The Qmail server does not house any local mail accounts, it acts as a pure
relay for our internal mail server, I am currently relaing mail for 8
internal domains...

Suggestions would be appreciated.

Regards
Zenn

[001] - abcm2ps 3.1.1 (Development)
  by Guido Gonzato (http://freshmeat.net/users/goccia/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 03:48

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Conversion

About: abcm2ps is a package that converts music tunes from ABC format to
PostScript. Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5, it was developed mainly to
print baroque organ scores that have independant voices played on one or
more keyboards, and a pedal-board. It introduces many extensions to the
ABC language that make it suitable for classical music. 

Changes: Minor bugfixes were made.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 10:52

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Sound Synthesis

About: amSynth is a realtime polyphonic analogue modeling synthesizer. It
provides a virtual analogue synthesizer in the style of the classic Moog
Minimoog/Roland Junos. It offers an easy-to-use interface and synth
engine, while still creating varied sounds. It runs as a standalone
application, using either the ALSA audio and MIDI sequencer system or the
plain OSS devices. It can be played with an external MIDI controller
keyboard, a software virtual keyboard, or through a MIDI sequencer. All
parameters can be controlled over MIDI. 

Changes: The ALSA driver has been MMAPed for improved performance.
Recordings are now output to .wav files. Minor performance tweaks have
been made on the envelope generators, the build process, etc.

  by Avinash Chopde (http://freshmeat.net/users/avinash1/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:10

Text Processing

About: cdlabelgen is a Perl script that generates printouts suitable for
use as CD jewel case inserts or CD envelopes. Both normal sized cases and
slim cases are handled. cdlabelgen can be used to create table of contents
for music CDs, archival CDs, etc., with customizable logos or background
images, and it generates PostScript files as output. The package also
includes a Perl CGI Web script which accepts JPEG images as logos or
backgrounds, and can also create PDF output files.

Changes: It is now possible to specify line width for the cover/tray edges
or to omit edge lines entirely. Control over logo placement has been
added: logos can now be moved and scaled as required on the output.
Support for A4 page printouts has been added.

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: CD Audio :: CD Ripping
Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: CD Audio :: CD Writing
System :: Archiving

About: Cdrecord creates home-burned CDs with a CD-R/CD-RW recorder. It
works as a burn engine for several applications. Cdrecord supports CD
recorders from many different vendors; all SCSI-3/mmc and ATAPI/mmc

parallel-port, and SCSI drives, audio CDs, data CDs, and mixed CDs, full
multi-session support, CD-RWs (rewritable), TAO, DAO and human-readable
error messages. Cdrecord includes remote SCSI support and can access local
or remote CD-writers.

Changes: cdrecord now writes MCN/ISRC even in RAW mode. A bug that caused
cdrecord to write wrong relative time stamps into the pregap of audio CDs
when writing in RAW mode with pregapsize !=0 has been fixed.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 10:36

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content

About: CherryPy is a Python-based tool for developing dynamic Web sites.
It sits between a compiler and an application server. Compiling source
files generates an executable containing everything to run the Web site,
including an HTTP server. CherryPy lets you develop your Web site in an
object-oriented way, using both regular Python and a templating language.
It also comes with a handy standard library for things like cookie-based
authentication, form handling, HTTP authentication, etc.

Changes: This release adds built-in caching capability and some compiler
optimization.

[013] - DaDaBIK 2.1 beta 
  by Eugenio (http://freshmeat.net/users/eugenio/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 18:36

Database :: Front-Ends

About: DaDaBIK is a PHP application that allows you to easily create a
highly customizable Web interface for a MySQL database in order to search,
insert, update, and delete records; all you need do is specify a few
configuration parameters. It is available in English, Italian, Dutch,
German, Spanish, and French. 

Changes: A new, lighter, and easier to use administration interface
(related to the internal table manager) is now available. The form now has
a better layout, and all the fields are correctly aligned, including
dates. All the translations are now up-to-date. It is now possible, for
select_single fields, to choose ""other"" during an insert and fill a
textbox by hand with an alternative value. That value will update the
select options, unless the option has been driven with a custom query
(""SQL:......""). It is now possible to choose whether a field has to be
displayed on the details page. Other changes and bugfixes have been added.

[020] - Dump/Restore 0.4b31 
  by Stelian Pop (http://freshmeat.net/users/spop/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 12:57

System :: Archiving :: Backup
System :: Archiving :: Compression
System :: Filesystems

About: The dump package contains both dump and restore. Dump examines
files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up, and
copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. The
restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental backups can then be
layered on top of the full backup. Single files and directory subtrees may
also be restored from full or partial backups.

Changes: This release fixes a bug (introduced with 0.4b29) which prevented
the use of a remote tape drive.

Printing

About: Gimp-Print is a collection of very high quality printer drivers for
UNIX/Linux. The goal of this project is uncompromising print quality and
robustness. Included with this package is the Print plugin for the GIMP
(hence the name), a CUPS driver, and two drivers (traditional and
IJS-based) for Ghostscript that may be compiled into that package. This
driver package is Foomatic-compatible and provides Foomatic data to enable
plug and play with many print spoolers. In addition, various printer
maintenance utilities are included. Many users report that the quality of
Gimp-Print on high end Epson Stylus printers matches or exceeds the
quality of the drivers supplied for Windows and Macintosh.

Changes: This release fixes a serious and longstanding problem whereby
prints to certain Epson printers hosted on a Windows system are
incomplete; the bottom of the last page of the print is chopped off. There
are also some minor tweaks for the Epson Stylus Photo 2100/2200.

[046] - Lindenmayer Systems in Python 1.0 
  by Eleventh Hour (http://freshmeat.net/users/xihr/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:52

Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence
Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics
Text Processing :: General

About: Lindenmayer Systems in Python provides a simple implementation of
Lindenmayer systems (also called ""L-systems"" or ""substitution systems"").
In basic form, a Lindenmayer system consists of a starting string of
symbols from an alphabet which has repeated transitions applied to it,
specified by a list of transition search-and-replace rules. In addition to
the standard formulation, two alternative implementations are included:
sequential systems (in which at most one rule is applied) and tag systems
(in which the transition only takes place at the beginning and end of the
string). Despite being implemented entirely in Python, for reasonable
rules on a modern machine, the system is capable of running thousands of
generations per second. Lindenmayer systems are found in artificial
intelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal
patterns (usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle
commands), organic-looking patterns that can simulate plants or other
living things, or even music.

languages. 

Changes: This release features support for right-to-left languages, a
photo component which dynamically generates thumbnails and scaled images,
and support for HTTP authentication (so cookies are no longer required).

[059] - OSSP cfg 0.9.0

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 19:01

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Operating System
Text Processing

About: OSSP cfg is a ISO-C library for parsing arbitrary C/C++-style
configuration files. A configuration is sequence of directives, each
directive consists of zero or more tokens, and each token can be either a
string or again a complete sequence. This means the configuration syntax
has a recursive structure and allows you to create configurations with
arbitrarily-nested sections. The configuration syntax also provides
complex single/double/balanced quoting of tokens,
hexadecimal/octal/decimal character encodings, character escaping, C/C++
and shell-style comments, etc. The library API allows importing of a
configuration text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), traversing the AST,
and optionally exporting the AST again as a configuration text.

About: OSSP fsl offers the syslog API otherwise provided by libc. Instead
of writing to the syslogd process, it uses the powerful OSSP l2 logging
capabilities. It is a drop-in link-time replacement which enables any
syslog consumer to take advantage of OSSP l2 by just linking this library
in before libc. The program is intended to apply OSSP l2 functionality to
existing syslog-based third-party programs without the requirement to
change the source code of the program.

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Logging

About: OSSP l2 is a C library providing a very flexible and sophisticated
Unix logging facility. It is based on the model of arbitrary number of
channels, stacked together in a top-down data flow tree structure with
filtering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave
nodes. Channel trees can be either constructed manually through
lower-level API functions or all at once with a single API function
controlled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree. For
generating log messages, a printf-style formatting engine is provided
which can be extended through callback functions. The data flow inside the
channel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are
assigned to each individual channel.

[062] - Papercut NNTP Server 0.8.3 
  by Jo�o Prado Maia (http://freshmeat.net/users/jcpm/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:34

Communications :: Usenet News
Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules

About: Papercut is a multi-threaded NNTP server written in Python. Its
main objective is to integrate existing Web-based message board software
(Phorum on the first few versions) with a Usenet front-end. However, its
extensibility enables developers to write their own container for the
storage of the Usenet articles (messages). That means that the code is
extensible enough that you could write new containers to integrate the
news server with other Web message board projects or even other ways to
store the messages. 

Changes: The various storage modules have been redesigned, and initial
code for NTTP authentication was added. New features include a standalone
MySQL storage module with no Web front-end, an authentication module for
Phorum, and the concept of a 'read-only' / 'read-write' server with
password protection. Most (if not all) of the features are working.

created when the first user is installed. Deletion of users and websites
is now possible. The menu is now somewhat more user friendly. Webalizer
config files are now stored in a users' own directory, and the domains
belonging to each user are now tracked better.

display files, allowing you to template most of the frontend, and allowing
you to specify an already existing user table. Also included is a DBI for
portability, ANSI SQL for portability, an advanced and documented API,
full multilingual support, and full i18n support for date functions. 

Changes: This release has migrated to PEAR. It has an expanded API, major

[083] - Station Location and Information 1.2 
  by John Kodis (http://freshmeat.net/users/kodis/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 10:48

Communications :: Ham Radio

About: The station-info program searches for and displays AM, FM, and TV
station entries from databases supplied by the US Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). It provides many ways of selecting a collection of
stations for display, and several criteria by which these stations can be
sorted. Detailed information on each station is available, including an
antenna radiation pattern, ownership information, and whatever else seems
useful.  

Changes: This release adds correct displaying of antenna patterns
(previously, they were shown rotated, reversed, and upside down). It also
adds a compass rose and the station callsign to the antenna pattern
display. It accepts station callsigns as location specifications. It
avoids trying to draw in details windows that have been closed. All the
cdbs and .loc files have been moved to $PKGDATADIR (by default,
/usr/local/share/station-info/).

[084] - Sylpheed 0.8.1claws (Claws)
  by Paul Mangan (http://freshmeat.net/users/daWB/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 18:38

Communications :: Email :: Email Clients (MUA)

About: Sylpheed is a GTK+ based, lightweight, and fast email client.
Almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard. It also has many
features such as multiple accounts, POP3/APOP support, thread display, and
multipart MIME. One of Sylpheed's future goals is to be fully
internationalized. The messages are managed in the MH format, so you'll be
able to use it together with another mailer that uses the MH format. 

Changes: This release fixes the IMAP slowdown, plugs several memory leaks,
adds a script to enable sending documents as attachments from
OpenOffice.org, and contains more improvements and bugfixes.

[089] - Trackbox 0.4 
  by Thread (http://freshmeat.net/users/threadbean/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:16

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Players

About: Trackbox is a pure Perl music server. A trackbox client can connect
to the server, and issue commands to it. The server maintains a single
playlist, volume setting, etc. that can be modified remotely by connected
clients. Any file format for which there is a commandline player is
supported, and it has a very simple config file. One possible application
could be a LAN party in which everybody would like to influence the music
selections. 

Changes: This release has playlist save/restore support, a 'move' command
(playlist order), the ability to set the initial play/shuffle/random flag
settings (and start the server in your init scripts), and some other minor
features/changes. There are some clients under development.

[090] - tui-sh 1.2.0 
  by yeupou (http://freshmeat.net/users/mathieur/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 10:13

Utilities

About: tui-sh stands for text user interface in a shell, and is a package
of miscellaneous scripts which are useful for a variety of purposes. They
are all designed to be faster and easier to use than the command line that
would normally be required to accomplish the same task. For example, there
are scripts for mass conversion of WAV files to Ogg files and Ogg files to
WAV files, for converting LaTeX to PostScript and viewing the output in
ggv, for creating image thumbnails, for converting from the Euro to
another currency, and for automated updating via FTP. 

Changes: This release features usage of gettext for internationalization
and getopt.

[092] - Valgrind 1.0.0 
  by sigra (http://freshmeat.net/users/sigra/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 23:04

Software Development :: Testing

About: Valgrind is a tool that helps you find memory management problems
in programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads
and writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as use of
uninitialized memory, reading/writing of memory after it has been freed,
reading/writing off the end of malloced blocks, reading/writing
inappropriate areas on the stack, memory leaks in which pointers to
malloced blocks are lost forever, passing of uninitialized and/or
unaddressable memory to system calls, and mismatched use of malloc/new/new
[] vs. free/delete/delete []. 

Changes: Support for the x86 fldenv instruction, a fix for an obscure
optimiser bug causing failures like this: ""insane instruction 27: PUTFL
%ecx"", a fix for dying with bus errors running programs which mess with
the x86 AC (alignment-check) flag, fixes to make it compile and run on Red
Hat ""Limbo"" (7.3.92), a fix for a possible assert failure having to do
with free() when running cachegrind (not valgrind), and final manual
adjustments.

Education
System :: Systems Administration

About: VNC Reflector is a specialized VNC server which acts as a proxy
between a real VNC server (a host) and a number of VNC clients. It was
designed to work efficiently with large number of clients. It can switch
between different hosts on the fly, preserving client connections. It
supports reverse host-to-reflector connections, it can save host sessions
on disk, and it also has other unique features.  

Changes: Handling of host connections with different desktop geometries
was improved, and support for dynamic changes to desktop size was
implemented. The ability to specify negative display numbers was added. A
few other new features were implemented, and a number of bugs were fixed.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 11:07

Communications :: Email
Communications :: Email :: Mail Transport Agents
Communications :: Email :: Post-Office :: POP3

About: vpopmail (vchkpw) is a collection of programs and a library to
automate the creation and maintenance of virtual domain email
configurations for qmail installations using either a single UID/GID or
any valid UID/GID in /etc/passwd with a home directory. Features are
provided in the library for other applications which need to maintain
virtual domain email accounts. It supports named or IP-based domains. It
works with vqadmin, qmailadmin, vqregister, sqwebmail, and courier-imap.
It supports MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, LDAP, and file-based (DJB constant
database) authentication. It supports SMTP authentication combined with
the qmail-smtp-auth patch. It supports user quotas and roaming users (SMTP
relay after POP authentication). 

Changes: This release adds one last patch for the vgetent problem,
comments out the lseek definition for BSD users, replaces the old
qmail-pop3d-maildirquota patch with the qmail-maildir++ patch (which adds
Maildir++ support not only to qmail-pop3d, but also to qmail-local), and
updates the documentation.

[095] - Vstr string library 0.9.9 
  by Nevyn (http://freshmeat.net/users/nevyn/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:14

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Vstr is a string library designed for network communication, but
applicable in a number of other areas. It works on the idea of separate
nodes of information, and works on the length/ptr model and not the
termination model a la ""C strings"". It can also do automatic referencing
for mmap() areas of memory, and includes a portable version of a
printf-like function.

Changes: The vstr_export_buf() function now performs automatic bounds
checking in the same way as vstr_export_cstr_buf(). vstr_sc_read_*() now
works even if the vstr isn't configured to have an iovec cache. Work on
internal symbol hiding has been made, making the library smaller and
faster.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: FileManager is a secure (SSL), multi-user, and Web- based program
for file, directory, and remote  command management. It is written in
Perl, for  Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It displays  full
directory information; allows file viewing,  deleting, renaming,
uploading, downloading, etc.;  assists in directory navigation; and can
execute  any command for which the user account has  privilege.
FileManager also comes with a built-in  text editor for quick editing and
file updates. 

Changes: A security hole that allowed authorized users to view any file on
the system has been fixed. The security certificate has been extended.
Support has been added for 29 more OS types. The find function now works
for non-root, jailed users. A new option controls whether or not a user
can ""click"" outside their home directory tree. The AllowRootUser parameter
can now disable the 'root' user. A bug that prevented non-root, jailed
users from creating subdirectories, a ""group"" permissions access problem,
and a bug in the ""Command Line"" box which prevented using the asterisk
wildcard have all been fixed.

Text Editors

About: The goal of the XMLtype project is to create a console-based editor
of XML document-oriented files in UTF-8 encoding. It is designed from the
beginning for multilingual use, even for writing bi-directional texts
(e.g. mixed English and Hebrew). The design focuses on comfortable and
fast typing of well-formed XML documents. Thus XMLtype is not meant to
compete with advanced console editors like Emacs or VIM. For full
functionality, XMLtype requires UTF-8 console support. It is being
developed under Linux and for the ANSI/VT-100 terminal.

As a Mets <a href=""http://davenet.userland.com/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod"">fan</a> since 1962, I think it's great that sites like this exist and are flourishing. Like Bryan Hoch, the webmaster, I also run websites as a labor of love, and know there isn't generally a whole lot of money left over after you pay for bandwidth. I totally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money. The site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major League Baseball. If you go <a href=""http://www.metsonline.net/metsonline-ceaseandde
 sist.html"">deeper</a> you see that Hoch contributed his time for free to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over by MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves based on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another side to it, so let's keep an open mind. But to the owners of the Mets, please remember, it's the fans that make it work, and it's pretty clear that this website is from the fans, for the fans and the team, and that's a good thing.&nbsp;<a href=""http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/07/30#When:7:11:28AM"" title=""Permanent link to this item in archive.""><img src=""http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif"" height=""9"" width=""6"" border=""0""></a><br><br>

I'd be happy to do that -- providing the nonspam.log and spam.log files

for the SpamAssassin GA system.

So, if anyone wants a go, contact me by mail.

Always happy to contribute my mass-check logs.  The only problem is that was
all have to be using the exact same ruleset.

[SAtalk] Protect individual MS-Exchange mailboxes,Jake Mohnkern <JMohnkern@COMMONWEALTH.COM>,"""'spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net'"" <spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net>","Fri, 02 Aug 2002 10:21:07 -0400","I rigged this up for testing before I commit to a sitewide rollout of
Spamassassin as an SMTP relay.
It is more work, but it avoids sitewide changes in mail delivery during the
early stages of testing.

On the Exchange server... (mail.yourdomain.com)
Create a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the
mailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address.

Create a ""custom recipient"" with the old SMTP address
(spammedalot@yourdomain.com). Create another custom recipient pointing at a
local user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com).

Set the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom
recipient. (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory)

On the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com)
Set up a dummy user, in this case ""killspam""
Give killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private
smtp address back on the Exchange server.

So the message flow is like this:

Mail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for
spammedalot@yourdomain.com

spammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to
killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com

Following the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to
nomorespam@yourdomain.com


Wowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second
one I protected was postmaster.

As you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one
dummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address
you want to protect. Like I said, it is more work, but until I am done
load-testing, this is the way it will stay.

1. Feedback, notes and comments
-------------------------------------------------------------------
COCKLES OF ONE'S HEART  You may recall that I was a bit suspicious
of the story I told in last week's issue. James Woodfield pointed
out that there is another possible explanation. In medieval Latin,
the ventricles of the heart were at times called ""cochleae cordis"",
where the second word is derived from ""cor"", heart. Those unversed
in Latin could have misinterpreted ""cochleae"" as ""cockles"". Oddly,
""cochlea"" in Latin means ""snail"" (from the shape of the ventricles
- it's also the name of the spiral cavity of the inner ear), so if
this story is right we should really be speaking of warming the
snails of one's heart.

SERRANCIFIED  Many of you supplied your own memories of this odd
expression that I tried to make sense of last week. Taken together,
they show that the expression is best known in Canada and that it
was originally something like ""My sufficiency has been suffonsified
and anything additional would be superfluous"". That form of the
word is the one that is most common in online searches, where the
Canadian focus is also obvious. Cheryl Caesar noted that it appears
in a passage in Margaret Atwood's novel, ""Cat's Eye"": she has two
teenage girls living in Toronto in the 1940s who say, ""Are you
sufficiently sophonisified?"". A Vancouver restaurant reviewer has
the pen name ""Sufficiently Suffonsified"". Oddly, there's also a
1999 record by the Austrian band Cunning Dorx entitled ""Paradigms
Suffonsified"". G H Gordon Paterson suggested that the word might be
a punning blend of ""sufficient"" and ""fancified"". There are some
tantalising suggestions that it may actually be Scots, and not New
World at all.

ABSQUATULATE  I have been gently remonstrated with for describing
""sockdologer"" as one of the products of early American linguistic
inventiveness that hasn't survived to the present day. Many people
gave me examples of current or recent use. I stand corrected.


2. Turns of Phrase: Thinspiration
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of the key words associated with a deeply disquieting
online trend. In the past couple of years or so a number of Web
sites and chatrooms have appeared which actively promote anorexia
nervosa (known on the sites as ""ana"") and other eating disorders as
lifestyle choices. Since 90% of anorexics are young women, these
""pro-ana"" sites are usually run by and attract that group (one term
sometimes used for them is ""weborexics""). Sites offer suggestions
on how to become and remain thin, often through tips on avoiding
eating, and how to disguise the condition from family and friends.
Other themes sometimes featured on such sites are self-mutilation
(""cutting"") and bulimia (""mia""). Thin women, such as supermodels
and Calista Flockhart, are presented as ""thinspirations"", examples
to emulate. Sites have had names such as Starving for Perfection,
Wasting Away on the Web and Dying To Be Thin. Medical professionals
in the US and UK are deeply concerned about them, because they
accentuate the low self-regard of young women, who are particularly
prone to eating disorders, put their lives at risk, and discourage
them from facing their illness and seeking treatment for it.

The Internet is home to a number of pro-eating disorder Web sites -
- places where sufferers can discuss tips, trade low-calorie
recipes and exchange poems and art that may be used as ""triggers""
or so-called ""thinspiration.""
                                         [""Calgary Sun"", Feb. 2002]

A new trend among young adults has been sweeping the nation: pro-
anorexia Web sites. Also known as pro-ana, these sites glorify
anorexia nervosa and offer ""thinspiration"" on maintaining a
starvation lifestyle.
                                     [""University Wire"", Apr. 2002]


3. Weird Words: Usufructuary  /ju:zjU'frVktju:@rI/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A person who has the use or enjoyment of something, especially
property.

We are short of words that contain four u's. Among the few that are
even relatively common (leaving aside the Hawaiian ""muu-muu"") are
""tumultuously"" and ""unscrupulous"", although some rare words like
""pustulocrustaceous"" and ""pseudotuberculous"" are also recorded.

The term comes from Roman law. ""Usufruct"" is the right of temporary
possession or enjoyment of something that belongs to somebody else,
so far as that can be done without causing damage or changing its
substance. For example, a slave in classical Rome could not own
anything. Things he acquired as the result of his labour he merely
held ""usus (et) fructus"", under ""use (and) enjoyment"" - it was his
master who actually owned them.

The term remains in use in modern US legal practice and elsewhere.
These days a ""usufructuary"" can be a trustee who enjoys the income
from property he holds in trust for somebody else. Many Native
American groups hold land on a ""usufruct"" basis, with rights to
enjoy the renewable natural resources of the land for hunting and
fishing.


4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How does the term ""three sheets to the wind"" denote drunkenness?
[Benjamin Weatherston]

A. It's a sailor's expression.

We ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail, but in
traditional sailing-ship days, a ""sheet"" was actually a rope,
particularly one attached to the bottom corner of a sail (it comes
from an Old English term for the corner of a sail). The sheets were
vital, since they trimmed the sail to the wind. If they ran loose,
the sail would flutter about in the wind and the ship would wallow
off its course out of control.

Extend this idea to sailors on shore leave, staggering back to the
ship after a good night on the town, well tanked up. The irregular
and uncertain locomotion of the jolly seafarers must have reminded
onlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose.
Perhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image
across, so the saying became ""three sheets to the wind"".

Our first written example comes from that recorder of low life,
Pierce Egan, in his ""Real life in London"" of 1821. But it must
surely be much older.

                        -----------

Q. My East End mother-in-law used to say she was ""well and truly
mogadored"" when she was puzzled by something. Any idea of
derivation and meaning? [Bryan]

A. Now that's a bit of British slang I haven't heard in years,
though it is still around (Nanny Ogg uses it in one of Terry
Pratchett's Discworld fantasy stories, I am told). As you say, it
means that somebody is puzzled, confused, or ""all at sea"". It's
also sometimes spelled ""moggadored"", though it doesn't turn up in
print much in either spelling. (No relation to the British word
""moggy"" for a cat, by the way, which seems to be a pet form of
""Margaret"".)

The writers of slang dictionaries are decidedly mogadored about its
origin. It looks very much like rhyming slang for ""floored"", which
is likewise slang, meaning dumbfounded or confused. But the dispute
arises over what the root is. Some say it is Irish, from ""magagh"",
to mock, jeer or laugh at, via an unrecorded intermediate form
""mogadói"".

Others suggest that, like some other East End slang terms, it
derives from the Gypsy language Romany (Cockney slang is like
London itself, a melting pot, in which words from many sources are
amalgamated, including Yiddish and old-time forces slang derived
from languages around the world). In this case the source may be
""mokardi"" or ""mokodo"", something tainted (these Romany words also
provide the root for yet another slang phrase, ""to put the mockers
on something"", to jinx it).

Sorry not to be able to be more definite!

                        -----------

Q. I was having an interesting discussion with an American
professor of business studies who also consults to industry. She
was recalling an unbudgeted initiative within a major software
corporate, which the UK managing director described as a ""skunk
project"". I have seen this epithet before, usually in the phrase
""skunk works"", meaning a semi-official project team that is tacitly
licensed to bend the rules and think outside the box. I wonder what
the derivation is? I don't think it can refer to the smelly wild
animal, but neither I think can it refer to the street term for a
strong variant of marijuana. Can you shed any light? [Martin
Hayman]

A. We must start in Dogpatch, the fictional place in the backwoods
of upper New York State made famous between 1934 and 1977 as the
home of professional mattress tester Li'l Abner, in the comic strip
written and drawn by Al Capp. The original was actually ""Skonk
Works"", the place where Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe brewed
their highly illicit bootleg Kickapoo Joy Juice from ingredients
such as old shoes and dead skunks. (""Skonk"" is a dialect variant of
""skunk"".)

We must now move to the very real Burbank, California. In 1943, a
small group of aeronautical engineers working for the then Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation (headed by Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson) were
given the rush job of creating an entirely new plane from scratch,
the P-80 ""Shooting Star"" jet fighter. This they did in 143 days, 37
days ahead of schedule. Their secret project was housed in a
temporary structure roofed over with an old circus tent, which had
been thrown up next to a smelly plastics factory. The story goes
that one of the engineers answered the phone on a hot summer day
with the phrase ""Skonk Works here"" and the name stuck. It is also
said that Al Capp objected to their use of his term and it was
changed to Skunk Works.

One division of the company, formally the Lockheed Martin Advanced
Development Program, is still known as the Skunk Works. The term
has been trademarked by Lockheed Martin, who have been aggressive
in protecting it.

As a generic term, it dates from the 1960s. One definition is very
much that of the original and the one you describe: a small group
of experts who drop out of the mainstream of a company's operations
in order to develop some experimental technology or new application
in secrecy or at speed, unhampered by bureaucracy or the strict
application of regulations (Kelly Johnson formulated 14 visionary
rules for running such an operation, which are still regarded as
valid even now). It is also sometimes used for a similar group that
operates semi-illicitly, without top-level official knowledge or
support, though usually with the tacit approval of immediate
management.

We're currently using a perceptron classifier. It *can't* learn
combinations of rules.[1]

I gave an example, assume 4 rules:
   SPAM = (A or B) and (C or D)

It cannot learn that function.

A decision tree classifier *can* learn that example, and the function
above, where a .5 S/O rule is only important in certain
circumstances. (Then again, it may be smartest to hardcode a meta-rule
for that case, rather than trust to a naive DT learner.)

[1] To be fair, nor can a Bayes classifier.

[SAtalk] German spam corpus / foreign language spam,Daniel Roethlisberger <daniel@roe.ch>,SAtalk <spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net>,"Wed, 21 Aug 2002 14:05:29 +0200","I've been lurking the SA lists since I installed SA on a production
machine a while back. While SA did a surprisingly accurate job on
detecting English language spam, it did not succeed very well on German
language spam, which I keep getting increasing amounts of lately. I've
got a lousy results with out of the box scores, very few spam is acually
cought.

What is the strategy with respect to foreign language spam recognition
in SA? I've seen extremely few non-english rules. Is there foreign
language rule development going on? Has anybody done work on German
spam?

In any case, I've started spam/nonspam corpi consisting of only German
(and Swiss-German, respectively) messages, to be able to help with
German rules. Anybody willing to contribute to the corpus feel free to
resend/bounce German spam in a sane way to spam@roe.ch . I cannot be
bothered to subscribe to SAsightings just for the odd German spam every
hundred++ messages.. how about a list for foreign language spam
sightings?

Has anybody done this before or am I on the edge of duplicating effort
here?

I've been thinking on this a bit. I think it would be best if there
would be general provisions for foreign language rules. In the spirit of
the ok_languages option; let users easily enable or disable rules in
certain languages. Like a foreign_rules option which could be used to
control which foreign rulesets are active. Usually people would want to
use checks in all languages which are in the ok_languages list.

Is there any development or are there plans along those lines? Are there
other people willing to contribute to effective spam filtering rules in
German language?

Any kind of feedback is welcome, even flames ;)

Dan

Quite interesting -- it's pretty similar to the spam phrases stuff.  As
Scott pointed out, this would work quite well as a naive Bayesian system.
(in fact, I think it may be quite close to being one already...)

I like the way ""FL"" -- ie. Florida -- is one of the top scoring terms. ;)

Also, when I was doing the spam-phrases stuff, I discounted the ff0000
thing, as HTML garbage! never realised it corresponded to ""bright red"" :(
Have we got a test for that?

Doesn't defeat this system at all. If you see that once, feed it into 
your bayesian classifier, and it classifies the URLs used for the 
images. Then next time it sees one, it knows with almost 100% accuracy 
that an email with one of those URLs is definitely spam.

In many ways this is like Razor, which is why I'm hacking on a 
distributed system to do this, to see if it's feasible to scale it globally.

the check_local tarball includes a program called miltrassassin.
It's a C Milter program speaking the SPAMD protocol so it will be
far more efficient than spamass-milter.
Check http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/miltrassassin.html
for some details about miltrassassin.                                                                                                                                                                     
The check_local tarball can be downloaded on
http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/beta.html

Another alternative solution is to use Mimedefang : it offers
anti-spam, attachment defanging, custom filtering.

I call it spam if I ask to be removed from the spamming list though. 
I occasionally buy X-10 stuff.  I've learned from past experiences to 
create a quick mail alias to get order confs and what not.  Then can 
it once the order is complete because those spamming SOBs will not 
stop filling my inbox with 3-6 ads per day.  I've LARTed them and 
their upstream numerous times asking to be list washed.  I don't even 
get an auto-ack.  I started a procmail recipe to reject mail to them 
and include a form letter (I was planning on later appending every 
piece of x-10 spam I've archived to the form letter for their reading 
pleasure...) but I haven't gotten it to work.  Bottom line, if I gave 
them permission to mail me (explicitly or via privacy policy), it's 
not spam but once I told them to stop mailing me then it's spam.

Sure.  I described it the way I understand it to another person off 
list a little while ago.


It has a couple different definitions.  The most common is Luser 
[sic] Attitude Readjustment Tool.  It was first used to describe the 
reporting of spam to ISPs that didn't think spam was bad.  Their 
attitude needed a little readjusting.  It has since taken on the 
generic meaning of reporting email/security incidents to the 
appropriate parties.  Somewhere the definition is online.  I can't 
seem to find the page though.


LART is about as good a word as any to describe reporting 
Rumplestiltskin attacks.  Come to think of it, I generally get a much 
better response to spam LARTs than I do to LARTs for other things. 
I'm always careful to say in the LART that the massive amounts probes 
on our system disrupted service to our customers and that we 
therefore consider it a DoS attack.  That tends to ellict a better 
response.  I also either include a log snippet in the email or I dump 
it to a file and make it accessible on a web server with other logs 
of hosts that abused our mail server.  That helps too. :)

II. BUGTRAQ SUMMARY
-------------------
1. OpenSSL SSLv2 Malformed Client Key Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5363
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5363
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in some versions of
OpenSSL.

When initiating an OpenSSL session, some information is shared between the
client and the server, including key data. The reported vulnerability lies
in the handling of the client key value during the negotiation of the
SSLv2 protocol.

A malicious client may exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a
malformed key to the vulnerable server. Careful exploitation may result in
execution of arbitrary code as the server process, and the attacker
gaining local access to the vulnerable system. More primitive attacks may
result in the server process crashing, possibly producing a denial of
service condition.

The consequences of exploitation may vary with the nature of the
application using OpenSSL.

Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

2. Abyss Web Server HTTP GET Request Directory Contents Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5345
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5345
Summary:

Abyss Web Server is a freely available personal web server. It is
maintained by Aprelium Technologies and runs on Microsoft Windows
operating systems, as well as Linux.

A vulnerability has been reported for Abyss Web Server 1.0.3 running on a
Microsoft Windows platform. It is possible for an attacker to make a
request such that the contents of the specified directory are revealed.

The vulnerability occurs due to the manner in which excessive '/'
characters are handled in web requests. An attacker making a GET request
followed by 256 '/' characters will cause Abyss Web Server to return an
error page containing the directory listing of the specified directory.

An attacker may be able to use this information to launch further,
potentially damaging attacks, against a vulnerable system.

3. DotProject User Cookie Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5347
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5347
Summary:

dotproject is web-based project management software, written in PHP.  It
is designed to run on Unix and Linux variants.

dotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypass
authentication and gain administrative access to the software.

This may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie'
value either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.  For example,
the attacker may manually craft a cookie with a 'user_cookie' value of 1
and submit it to the project management system.  An attacker may also
submit a malicious web request with the 'user_cookie' URI parameter set to
1.  In both instances, the attacker will gain administrative access to the
project management system.

This problem is due to the software relying on the 'user_cookie' value to
authenticate the user.

4. OpenSSL SSLv3 Session ID Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5362
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5362
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL. The vulnerability affects
SSLv3 session IDs.

When initiating contact with SSLv3 servers, clients and servers alike
exchange information. Session information is stored in a session key with
a unique session ID.

Reportedly when a an oversized SSL version 3 session ID is supplied to a
client from a malicious server, it is possible to overflow a buffer on the
remote system. This could result in key memory areas on the vulnerable,
remote system being overwritten, including stack frame data.

An attacker may be able to take advantage of this vulnerability to execute
malicious code on a vulnerable SSLv3 client machine.

Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

5. phpBB2 Gender Mod Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5342
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5342
Summary:

phpBB2 is an open-source web forum application that is written in PHP and
backended by a number of database products. It will run on most Unix and
Linux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Gender Mod is a modification for phpBB2 which allows the association of a
gender with a given user profile. A SQL injection vulnerability has been
reported in this mod.

A malicious user may modify the specified value for 'gender' when updating
their profile. It is possible to include additional SQL statements in this
string, and subvert the SQL statement used to update the user profile.

It has been reported possible to gain administrative access to the phpBB2
site through exploitation of this issue. Other attacks may be possible,
including the ability to view sensitive database information or to modify
additional information stored in the database.

6. ShoutBox Form Field HTML Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5354
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5354
Summary:

shoutBOX is web-based user feedback software.  It is written in PHP and
runs on Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating
systems.

ShoutBox does not sufficiently sanitize HTML tags from input supplied via
form fields.  In particular, the user website URL field of the feedback
form is not sanitized of HTML tags.

Attackers may exploit this lack of input validation to inject arbitrary
HTML and script code into pages that are generated by the script.  This
may result in execution of attacker-supplied code in the web client of a
user who visits such a page.  HTML and script code will be executed in the
security context of the site hosting the software.

This condition may be exploited to hijack web content or potentially steal
cookie-based authentication credentials.

7. Sympoll File Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5360
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5360
Summary:

Sympoll is web-based voting booth software.  It is implemented in PHP and
will run on most Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Sympoll is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to disclose
the contents of arbitrary webserver readable files.  This vulnerability is
only present on hosts which are running the vulnerable version of the
software and have the PHP 'register_globals' directive enabled.  The
source of this vulnerability is reported to be insufficient integrity
checking of variables.

The vendor has stated that this issue is only believed to affect Sympoll
version 1.2.

Exploitation of this issue on Microsoft Windows operating systems may
potentially expose arbitrary system files since webservers typically run
in the SYSTEM context.

8. OpenSSL ASN.1 Parsing Error Denial Of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5366
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5366
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A remotely exploitable denial of service condition has been reported in
the OpenSSL ASN.1 library.

This vulnerability is due to parsing errors and affects SSL, TLS, S/MIME,
PKCS#7 and certificate creation routines.  In particular, malformed
certificate encodings could cause a denial of service to server and client
implementations which depend on OpenSSL.

Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

9. William Deich Super SysLog Format String Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5367
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5367
Summary:

super is an open source set-uid root utility that allows for a similar
functionality to that of the sudo utility. It is written for use on Linux
and Unix variant operating systems.

super is prone to a format string vulnerability. This problem is due to
incorrect use of the syslog() function to log error messages. It is
possible to corrupt memory by passing format strings through the
vulnerable logging function. This may potentially be exploited to
overwrite arbitrary locations in memory with attacker-specified values.

The vulnerability is a result of compiling super with syslog support. Due
to an error in the file, error.c, users that are not in the super
configuration file will still be able to execute code with root
privileges.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary instructions with root privileges.

10. Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload Plain Text Password Storage Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5369

Summary:

Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload is a small script designed to facilitate
uploading of files to a remote server. It is written in Perl and should
work with Microsoft Windows and Linux and Unix variant operating systems.

A problem with Eupload 1.0 may make it possible for remote attackers to
gain access to sensitive information.

Eupload does not cryptographically protect stored passwords. Passwords
contained in the configuration file, password.txt, are stored in plain
text. They may be read by simply viewing the file. The file, password.txt,
is stored in a web accessible location and is, itself, accessible for
retrieval. Thus it is trivial for an attacker to obtain user passwords and
abuse the Eupload service.

This problem could allow an attacker to gain access to the passwords to
protected resources.

11. Util-linux File Locking Race Condition Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5344
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5344
Summary:

The util-linux package is a set of commonly used system utilities such as
'chfn' and 'chsh'.  It is included with many Linux distributions.

A race condition has been reported in code shared by the util-linux
utilities.  The condition is related to file locking.  Failure to check
for the existence of a lockfile prior to sensitive operations may, under
specific circumstances, open a window of opportunity for attack.  The
util-linux utilities often write to sensitive files such as /etc/passwd/.
Attackers may exploit the condition to inject arbitrary data into these
files to elevate privileges.

The reported attacks are complex, time dependent and require specific
circumstances such as system administrator interaction and a large passwd
file.

Red Hat Linux is known to ship with util-linux as a core component.
Other distributions, those that are derived from Red Hat in particular,
may also be vulnerable.

It should be noted that the utilities included with the shadow-utils
package (shipped with SuSE Linux) are not vulnerable.

12. OpenSSL Kerberos Enabled SSLv3 Master Key Exchange Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5361
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5361
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL 0.9.7 pre-release versions.

This vulnerability is present only when Kerberos is enabled for a system
using SSL version 3.

When initiatiating contact between a SSLv3 server, master keys are
exchanged between the client and the server. When an oversized master key
is supplied to a SSL version 3 server by a malicious client, it may cause
a buffer to overflow on the vulnerable system. As a result, stack memory
on the vulnerable server will become corrupted. This could enable the
attacker to take control of the SSLv3 server process and cause it to
execute malicious, attacker supplied code.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

13. OpenSSL ASCII Representation Of Integers Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5364
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5364
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

Remotely exploitable buffer overflow conditions have been reported in
OpenSSL.  This issue is due to insufficient checking of bounds with
regards to ASCII representations of integers on 64 bit platforms.  It is
possible to overflow these buffers on a vulnerable system if overly large
values are submitted by a malicious attacker.

Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the vulnerable application, service or client.

Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

14. ParaChat Phantom User Denial Of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5370
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5370
Summary:

ParaChat is a web-based chatting system.  It is available for most Unix
and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.

ParaChat chat servers are prone to a denial of service condition.

If a user has left the webpage for a chat room using the Back or Forward
buttons of their browser in lieu of logging out, their account will still
be logged into the chat room until it times out 15 minutes later.  A
malicious user may do this repeatedly as different users to overload the
chat server with ""phantom"" users.  A denial of service may be the result.

15. OpenSSH Trojan Horse Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5374
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5374
Summary:

OpenSSH is a freely available implementation of the SSH client-server
protocol. It is distributed and maintained by the OpenSSH team.

Reportedly, the server hosting openssh, ftp.openbsd.org, was compromised
recently. It has been reported that the intruder made modifications to the
source code of openssh to include trojan horse code. Downloads of the
openssh source code from ftp.openbsd.org between July 30, 2002 and July
31, 2002 likely contain the trojan code.

The trojan code appears to be included in the file, bf-test.c. Reports say
that the trojan will run once upon compilation of openssh. The trojan
process is named 'sh' or the compiling user's default shell. Once executed
the trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32 on port 6667. The trojan
will then wait for one of three commands. A connection to the specified
address is attempted once every hour.

'D' will cause the trojan to execute '/bin/sh'. 'M' will cause the trojan
to respawn and 'A' will terminate the trojan process. It is highly
probable that this trojan will give remote root access to vulnerable
systems.

The following sites also have been reported to carry the trojaned version of openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz:
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp1.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/

It is not known whether other sites are affected as well.

FreeBSD has reported the following MD5 checksum information. The following
is the MD5 checksum of the trojaned version of openssh: MD5
(openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 3ac9bc346d736b4a51d676faa2a08a57

The following is the MD5 checksum of openssh in the FreeBSD ports
directory: MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8

Note that a different checksum does not mean the backdoor does not exist.

*** The OpenSSH team has released an advisory. Fixed versions of openssh
are available for download since 1300 UTC August 1, 2002. The following
MD5 checksum information was provided for fixed versions of openssh:

MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8
MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz.sig) = d5a956263287e7fd261528bb1962f24c
MD5 (openssh-3.4.tgz) = 39659226ff5b0d16d0290b21f67c46f2
MD5 (openssh-3.2.2p1.tar.gz) = 9d3e1e31e8d6cdbfa3036cb183aa4a01
MD5 (openssh-3.2.2p1.tar.gz.sig) = be4f9ed8da1735efd770dc8fa2bb808a

16. Bharat Mediratta Gallery Remote File Include Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5375
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5375
Summary:

Gallery is an open source web based photo album. It is written in PHP and
is available for Linux and Unix variant as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Gallery is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to include
arbitrary files located on remote servers. This issue is present in the
following PHP script files provided with Gallery: errors/configmode.php
errors/needinit.php errors/reconfigure.php errors/unconfigured.php
captionator.php

An attacker may exploit this by supplying a path to a file, 'init.php', on
a remote host as a value for the 'GALLERY_BASEDIR' parameter.

If the remote file is a PHP script, this may allow for execution of
attacker-supplied PHP code with the privileges of the webserver.
Successful exploitation may provide local access to the attacker.

17. John G. Myers MUnpack Malformed MIME Encoded Message Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5385
Remote: No
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5385
Summary:

John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for munpack 1.5.
Reportedly, it is possible to cause munpack to crash when it receives a
malformed email or NNTP news article.

As this vulnerability is the result of a buffer overflow condition, it may
be possible for an attacker to cause munpack to execute malicious attacker
supplied code. This has not, however, been confirmed.

18. Dispair Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5392
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5392
Summary:

Dispair is a web-based .tar.gz archive viewer.  It is written in Perl and
is available for Linux and Unix operating systems.

Dispair fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied input before it is
passed to the shell via the Perl open() function.  A remote attacker may
exploit this condition by injecting arbitrary commands into CGI parameters
in a request to the vulnerable script.

The result of successful exploitation is that attackers may potentially
exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying shell
with the privileges of the webserver process.

19. Mailreader Session Hijacking Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5393
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5393
Summary:

Mailreader is an open source project which allows POP3 mail access through
a web interface. Mailreader is implemented in Perl, and should work under
Microsoft Windows, Linux and other Unix based operating systems.

A vulnerability has been reported in some versions of Mailreader. It may
be possible for a remote attacker to hijack the session of a legitimate
user of the system. This may result in access to sensitive information, or
the ability to send mail and otherwise function as the legitimate user.

Full exploit details are not available. It is possible that this
vulnerability results from session information being tracked through CGI
parameters, which may be trivially spoofed by a remote user. This
possibility has not, however, been confirmed.

20. John G. Myers MPack/MUnpack Malformed Filename Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5386
Remote: No
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5386
Summary:

John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.

A vulnerability has been reported for mpack/munpack 1.5. Reportedly, it is
possible to cause munpack to create files outside of a designated
directory. When mpack/munpack receives a MIME encoded message with an
attachment that refers to a file, using a '../' sequence followed by the
filename, it may decode the attachment outside of a designated directory.

The impact of this vulnerability is limited as it has been reported that
munpack will only accept a single '../' sequence and will not overwrite
any existing files.

21. Fake Identd Client Query Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5351
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5351
Summary:

Fake Identd is an open source Ident server designed to return the same
information to all incoming requests. It is implemented by Tomi Ollila,
and available for Linux and a number of other Unix based operating
systems.

Reportedly, some versions of Fake Identd fail to properly handle long
client requests. A specially formatted request split across multiple TCP
packets may cause an internal buffer to overflow. Reportedly, execution of
arbitrary code as the Fake Identd server process is possible.

Fake Identd is designed to drop privileges. However, it has also been
reported that this behavior is flawed in some versions. As a result,
exploitation may result in the execution of code with root privileges.

Since perl itself is a scripting language, and allows code to be eval'ed,
I can't see why we need to go the whole hog and implement another
turing-complete scripting language in perl.

Let's go back to *why* this would be useful.  As far as I can see, you're
proposing this to deal with multi-match rules.  There's already a tracker
in the bug DB for these, with a proposed implementation.

  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47

I think this might have stalled due to shortcomings in the existnig

[Still trying to catch my breath] :-)

I guess there's no easy way to avoid this. In order to proactively
protect endusers they'll need to put such code (or part of it) into
their defs. Since antivirus products still gets smarter and smarter and
heuristics are getting better and better the odds aginst not running
into false positives are poor. Some products will woe plenty of these
some are better to avoid the madness (!). I'll leave you to do the test.
Consider that corporate and endusers are most likely using Microsoft
software without updating as they should. AV-software is now trying to
protect these poor souls adding proxy functionality to catch e.g.
malicious content in HTML based e-mails and for a good reason. Looking

FreeBSD-SA-02:36.nfs                                        Security Advisory
                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          Bug in NFS server code allows remote denial of service

Category:       core
Module:         nfs
Announced:      2002-08-05
Credits:        Mike Junk <junk@isilon.com>
Affects:        All releases prior to 4.6.1-RELEASE-p7
                4.6-STABLE prior to the correction date
Corrected:      2002-07-19 17:19:53 UTC (RELENG_4)
                2002-08-01 19:31:55 UTC (RELENG_4_6)

FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of
its filesystems, or parts of them, so that other hosts can access them
over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks.  NFS is
built on top of the Sun Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.

II.  Problem Description

A part of the NFS server code charged with handling incoming RPC
messages had an error which, when the server received a message with a
zero-length payload, would cause it to reference the payload from the
previous message, creating a loop in the message chain.  This would
later cause an infinite loop in a different part of the NFS server
code which tried to traverse the chain.

III. Impact

Certain Linux implementations of NFS produce zero-length RPC messages
in some cases.  A FreeBSD system running an NFS server may lock up
when such clients connect.

An attacker in a position to send RPC messages to an affected FreeBSD
system can construct a sequence of malicious RPC messages that cause
the target system to lock up.

IV.  Workaround

1) Disable the NFS server: set the nfs_server_enable variable to ""NO""
   in /etc/rc.conf, and reboot.

   Alternatively, if there are no active NFS clients (as listed by the
   showmount(8) utility), just killing the mountd and nfsd processes
   should suffice.

2) Add firewall rules to block RPC traffic to the NFS server from
   untrusted hosts.

V.   Solution

The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4, 4.5, and
4.6 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel and modules as described in
<URL:http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

Yeah, AWL IPs is a good thing for 2.40

When it works, yeah.  But it's so flakey I have to turn it off

[Ximian Updates] libpng has a potential buffer overflow when loading progressive images,Ximian GNOME Security Team <distribution@ximian.com>,Ximian Updates <updates@ximian.com>,"Tue, 06 Aug 2002 17:06:12 -0400","Severity: Security
Product: libpng
Keywords: Red Carpet libpng buffer overflow
URL: http://support.ximian.com/q?283
References: 
Release Notes for libpng 
ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png-group/archives/png-list.200207

libpng is a library used to create and manipulate PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) image files.

The 1.2.4* and 1.0.14 releases of libpng solve a potential buffer
overflow vulnerability[1] in some functions related to progressive
image loading. Programs such as mozilla and various others use these
functions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary
code or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.

These new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory
leaks in reading image functions.

Since most applications which display images use libpng, this affects
many applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red
Carpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.

Ximian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris
packages available. When distribution vendors update their packages,
they will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade
libpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2. You can also get packages
from the Ximian FTP site:

Dude, take that one up with Redhat, Suse, IBM or any of the other folks using
the name of a public project (i.e. Linux) for a commercial product.  ;-)

This is not only a concept with precedent it's actually quite common.

[VulnWatch] EEYE: Macromedia Shockwave Flash Malformed Header Overflow,Marc Maiffret <marc@eeye.com>,vulwatch <vulnwatch@vulnwatch.org>,"Thu, 08 Aug 2002 17:26:22 -0700","Macromedia Shockwave Flash Malformed Header Overflow

Release Date: August 8, 2002

Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)

Systems Affected:
Macromedia Shockwave Flash - All Versions;
Unix and Windows; Netscape and Internet Explorer

Description:
While working on some pre-release eEye Retina CHAM tools, an exploitable
condition was discovered within the Shockwave Flash file format called SWF
(pronounced ""SWIF"").

Since this is a browser based bug, it makes it trivial to bypass firewalls
and attack the user at his desktop. Also, application browser bugs allow you
to target users based on the websites they visit, the newsgroups they read,
or the mailing lists they frequent. It is a ""one button"" push attack, and
using anonymous remailers or proxies for these attacks is possible.

This vulnerability has been proven to work with all versions of Macromedia
Flash on Windows and Unix, through IE and Netscape. It may be run wherever
Shockwave files may be displayed or attached, including: websites, email,
news postings, forums, Instant Messengers, and within applications utilizing
web-browsing functionality.

Technical Description:
The data header is roughly made out to:

[Flash signature][version (1)][File Length(A number of bytes too
short)][frame size (malformed)][Frame Rate (malformed)][Frame Count
(malformed)][Data]

By creating a malformed header we can supply more frame data than the
decoder is expecting. By supplying enough data we can overwrite a function
pointer address and redirect the flow of control to a specified location as
soon as this address is used. At the moment the overwritten address takes
control flow, an address pointing to a portion of our data is 8 bytes back
from the stack pointer. By using a relative jump we redirect flow into a
""call dword ptr [esp+N]"", where N is the number of bytes from the stack
pointer. These ""jump points"" can be located in multiple loaded dll's. By
creating a simple tool using the debugging API and ReadMemory, you can
examine a process's virtual address space for useful data to help you with
your exploitation.

This is not to say other potentially vulnerable situations have not been
found in Macromedia's Flash. We discovered about seventeen others before we
ended our testing. We are working with Macromedia on these issues.

Protection:
Retina(R) Network Security Scanner already scans for this latest version of
Flash on users' systems. Ensure all users within your control upgrade their
systems.

Vendor Status:
Macromedia has released a patch for this vulnerability, available at:
http://www.macromedia.com/v1/handlers/index.cfm?ID=23293&Method=Full&Title=M
PSB02%2D09%20%2D%20Macromedia%20Flash%20Malformed%20Header%20Vulnerability%2

The problem is that Python has a much longer startup time than Perl 
(though this may have changed recently, I don't know). This is partly 
why Python was never very popular for CGIs.

I don't know from Pyzor, but I've always thought that the way services like
Razor and DCC could be truly useful is if there were a bunch of different
ones. We can assign them scores based on how trustworthy each one is, and
when a message is listed in multiple services you can pretty much trust that
it's spam.

 True, but that's the thinking of today, that the company mailserver can be
closed to you from the outside; because as it is today you can use any mail-
server that you've got access to. If there's a good reason for setting it up
they won't be that lazy in the future.

 A simple RFC could fix that today, either using a new header or extending the
Received-header with a code/value that the server later on can verify; maybe
something like this:

Received2: Date: [date];
	Local: sub.dom2.tld (IP#2);
	Remote: sub.dom3.tld (IP#3);
	Env-id: <the.usual.stuff@sub.dom1.tld>
	Code: [cache#, salted hashvalue, rsa or other signature]

 And then you have the two optional From and To, only added by the sending
server that's identified the local sender or the server accepting mail for a
certain user (to verify that it did really come via that server, in case you
forward it using procmail or something like it).
 You of course would need some standard for how to check these headers.

 Not perfect, but better than what we have today.

I think the summary thingy, with a mail based retreive facility, is a
good alternative. You avoid false positive, only one email to list all
the spam you received in one day, and you have full per user pref.

[VulnWatch] Foundstone Labs Advisory - Information Leakage in Orinoco and Compaq Access Points,Foundstone Labs <labs@foundstone.com>,"da@securityfocus.com, vulnwatch@vulnwatch.org","Fri, 09 Aug 2002 11:12:04 -0700","Foundstone Labs Advisory - 080902-APIL

Advisory Name:	Information Leakage in Orinoco and Compaq Access Points
 Release Date:	August 9th, 2002
  Application:	Orinoco Residential Gateway and Compaq WL310
    Platforms:	N/A
     Severity:	The ability to display/modify configuration information
      Vendors:	Orinoco (http://www.orinocowireless.com) and
                  Compaq (http://www.compaq.com)
      Authors:	Marshall Beddoe (marshall.beddoe@foundstone.com)
                  Tony Bettini (tony.bettini@foundstone.com)
CVE Candidate:	CAN-2002-0812
    Reference:	http://www.foundstone.com/advisories

Overview:

An information leakage vulnerability exists in Orinoco and Compaq OEM 
access points, disclosing the unique SNMP community string. As a result,

an attacker can query the community string and gain the ability to
change
system configuration including Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) keys and 
Domain Name Service (DNS) information.

Detailed Description:

The Compaq WL310 is an OEM Orinoco Residential Gateway access point.
Both the Compaq and Orinoco access points use a unique identification
number
found on the bottom of the access point for configuration through
their management client. This identification string is used as the
default SNMP read/write community string. The community strings appears
to be unchangable, unique, and not easily guessable. By sending a
specific packet to UDP port 192, the access point will return
information including the firmware version and the unique identification
value. The packet returned includes the value of system.sysName.0, which
in the case of the Compaq WL310 and Orinoco Residential Gateway,
includes
the unique identification value. The identification value can then be
used as the SNMP community string to view and modify the configuration.

The probe packet:
""\x01\x00\x00\x00\x70\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00""
""\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00""
""\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00""
""\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00""
""\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00""

Vendor Response:

Both vendors were notified of this issue on July 8th, 2002. According
to Orinoco, ""The Residential Gateway line has been discontinued.""

Solution:

Employ packet filtering on inbound requests to deny access to ports
192/udp and 161/udp on the access point.

FoundScan has been updated to check for this vulnerability. For more

I think this is missing the point a bit...  Yes, you can query the SNMP 
community string...  And yes, it's the default PW (not to mention the 
ESSID and last 5 characters of the default WEP key...)  But they're all 
easily changed, and indeed, it is highly recommended to do so in the 
manual.

Anyone who changes the default settings would not be vulnerable to this 
particular SNMP probe.  Of course, you can't account for end user 
stupidity, but that's beyond the scope of this advisory.  ;)

I've also heard (second hand, but on good authority) that the RG line is 
alive and well (hence the recent RG-1100, and the upcoming 802.11a 
version...)

A pastor walked into a neighborhood pub...,gkm@petting-zoo.net,0xdeadbeef@petting-zoo.net,"Sun, 18 Aug 2002 11:25:31 -0700","

A pastor walked into a neighborhood pub.  The place was hopping
with music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would
turn off.  Each time after the lights would go out the place would
erupt into cheers.

However, when the revelers saw the town pastor, the room went dead
silent.  He walked up to the bartender and asked, ""May I please
use the restroom?""

The bartender replied, ""I really don't think you should.""

""Why not?"" the pastor asked.

""Well, there is a statue of a naked woman in there, and her most
private part is covered only by a fig leaf.""

""Nonsense,"" said the pastor, ""I'll just look the other way.""

So the bartender showed the clergyman the door at the top of the
stairs, and he proceeded to the restroom.  After a few minutes, he
came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and
dancing again.  However, they did stop just long enough to give
the pastor a loud round of applause.  He went to the bartender and
said, ""Sir, I don't understand.  Why did they applaud for me just
because I went to the restroom?""

""Well, now they know you're one of us,"" said the bartender.  ""Would
you like a drink?""

""But, I still don't understand,"" said the puzzled pastor.

""You see,"" laughed the bartender, ""every time the fig leaf is lifted
on the statue, the lights go out in the whole place.  Now, how
about that drink?""

The Beer Scooter,gkm@petting-zoo.net,0xdeadbeef@petting-zoo.net,"Sun, 18 Aug 2002 15:18:04 -0700","

The Beer Scooter 

How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night
drinking and thought 'How on earth did I get home? As hard as you
try, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to
your house. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer
Scooter.

The Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased
to the drunk by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched
out since the decrease in the worship of the Roman Pantheon and
has bought a large batch of these magical devices. The Beer Scooter
works in the following fashion:-

The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the
""slurring gland"" begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of
his many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a
winged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits
them in their bedroom via the Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is
not cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket
cash is taken as payment.

This answers the second question after a night out 'How did I spend
so much money?'

Unfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are
thought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified
Drinking Injuries).  An undocumented feature of the beer scooter
is the destruction of time segments during the trip. The nature of
Trans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly
unaccounted for.

This answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell
happened?'

With good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT (Removal of
Embarrassing Moments In Time) add on, that automatically removes,
in descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately
one person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another and
quite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of
time. Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often
cause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending
the passenger to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences.
With recent models including a GPS, Bacchus made an investment in
a scooter drive-thru chain specialising in half eaten kebabs and
pizza crusts.

Another question answered!! For the family man, Beer Scooters come
equipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and
Thump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in
such a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs,
you are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity
springs ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the
CTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised
shins. The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some
scooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how
one person can apparently get through 260 Marlboro Lights in a
single night.

PS: Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably
get home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a
T-shirt.

JOTD: Sean Connery three times a night.,gkm@petting-zoo.net,0xdeadbeef@petting-zoo.net,"Mon, 19 Aug 2002 13:40:28 -0700","
Forwarded-by: Nev Dull <nev@sleepycat.com>

Sean Connery was interviewed by Michael Parkinson, and bragged that
despite his 72 years of age, he could still have sex three times a
night.

Lulu, who was also a guest, looked intrigued.

After the show, Lulu said, ""Sean, if Ah'm no bein too forward, Ah'd love
tae hae sex wi an aulder man. Let's go back tae mah place.""

So they go back to her place and have great sex. Afterwards, Sean  says,
""If you think that was good, let me shleep for half an hour, and we can
have even better shex. But while I'm shleeping, hold my baws in your
left hand and my wullie in your right hand.""

Lulu looks a bit perplexed, but says, ""Okay.""

He sleeps for half and hour, awakens, and they have even better sex.
Then Sean says, ""Lulu,  that was wonderful. But if you let me shleep
for an hour, we can have  the besht shex yet. But again, hold my baws
in your left hand, and my wullie in your right hand.""

Lulu is now used to the routine and  complies.

The results are mind blowing. Once it's all over, and the cigarettes
are lit, Lulu asks ""Sean, tell me, dis mah haudin yer baws in mah left
hand and yer wullie in mah right stimulate ye while ye're sleepin?""

Sean replies, ""No, but the lasht time I shlept with a Glashwegian, she
shtole my wallet.""

[unison-announce] New unison beta-release (2.9.20) now available,"""Benjamin C. Pierce"" <bcpierce@saul.cis.upenn.edu>","unison-announce@yahoogroups.com, unison-users@egroups.com","Mon, 19 Aug 2002 21:46:46 -0400","------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

---------------------------------------------------------------------~->

A new version of unison is now available for testing.  It incorporates
several small improvements over 2.9.1, but the main change is a fix to
a bug that had potentially serious safety consequences, but only for
the very small number of users that are in the habit of running more
than one instance of Unison at a time, in parallel.  These users are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.  Others can wait if they wish.

The release includes pre-built executables for Linux and Solaris, but
not Windows.  (We are looking for a Unison-Windows maintainer -- at
the moment, none of the active developers are regularly using Unison
on Windows, and we do not have a machine that is configured properly
for building executables for export.)

Grab it from here:
   http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download.html

Enjoy,

        -- Benjamin

   Changes since 2.9.1:
     * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number
       of simultaneous file transfers.
     * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files
       are stored.
     * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes
       when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and
       switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo'
       and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet
       fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks
       will not be synchronized correctly.)
     * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to
       the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The
       reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to
       silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and
       we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to
       other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g.
       synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for
       this suggestion.
     * Several small user interface improvements
     * Documentation
          + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as
            separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web
            page.
          + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance
            tuning.
     * Makefile
          + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk
            automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk
            installed
          + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX
       
   Changes since 2.8.1:
     * Changing profile works again under Windows
     * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy
       instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by
       a boolean option ``xferbycopying''.
     * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data
       transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.]
     * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically
       linked).
     * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and
       Unix
     * Small improvements:
          + If neither the
            tt USERPROFILE nor the
            tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put
            its temporary commit log (called
            tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the
            tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use
            tt C:.
          + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no =
            false; default = auto.
          + -silent implies -contactquietly
     * Source code:
          + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of
            the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific
            stuff can be made available for other projects.)
          + several Makefile and docs changes (for release);
          + further comments in ``update.ml'';
          + connection information is not stored in global variables
            anymore.
       
   Changes since 2.7.78:
     * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid
       leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs
       after Unison exited).
       
   Changes since 2.7.39:
     * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs
       are now both accessible).
     * User manual revised.
     * Added some new preferences:
          + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh
            programs.
          + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server''
            message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI).
     * Bug fixes:
          + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed
            column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to
            change.
          + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop
            if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode.
          + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii
            characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI.
            (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the
            people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii
            filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes
            things.)
          + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was
            reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.)
     * User interface and Unison behavior:
          + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI.
          + Added exit status for the textual user interface.
          + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or
            errors during update detection are now noted in the log file.
          + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format
          + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that
            tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of
            failing.
          + Made some improvements to the error messages.
          + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml.
       
   Changes since 2.7.7:
     * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system.
       It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the
       earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread
       library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight,
       non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This
       version appears stable.
       Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the
       multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to
       the user interface and logging, for example:
          + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the
            beginning, one for the end.
          + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left
            by a previous unison run, because warning does not work
            nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made
            less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by
            the user. They take the form
            .#<filename>.<serial>.unison.tmp.
     * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes
       Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just
       those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked
       as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart
       Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a
       previous run.
     * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the
       initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even
       if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g.,
       when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume
       mounted.)
     * Small improvements and bug fixes:
          + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather
            than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from
            them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these
            warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who
            have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their
            prefs files may now get error reports.
          + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name
            and line number.
          + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to
            the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed
            only in identical ways since last sync.''
          + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference
            files.
          + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first
            marshaled.
          + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously
            changing file: unison will give up after certain number of
            retries.
          + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger
            (force=older preference not working).
     * Compilation:
          + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk
            1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under
            Windows).
          + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform
            with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports
            building dynamically linked unison executables.
       
   Changes since 2.7.4:
     * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup
       sequence.
       
   Changes since 2.7.1:
     * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which
       preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are
       added to.
     * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so
       that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This
       bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to
       tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old
       version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an
       error message.)
       
   Changes since 2.6.59:
     * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal
       values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or
       default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when
       running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is
       default.
     * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All
       preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward
       compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not
       mentioned in the manual any more.
     * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now
       named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than
       appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge
       programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file
       contents.
     * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure
       that the server times out if the communication link is
       unexpectedly broken.
     * Bug fixes:
          + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination
            file.
          + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind
            a followed link.
          + Several other small fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.6.38:
     * Major Windows performance improvement!
       We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at
       a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it
       has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking
       for updates in large replicas.
       When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as
       'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates,
       instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause
       Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time,
       modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the
       update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However,
       Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the
       other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just
       before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this
       switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with
       fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have
       overlooked an update.
       Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested.
       If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what
       Unison is doing.
     * New functionality: centralized backups and merging
          + This version incorporates two pieces of major new
            functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer
            internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps
            a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a
            merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external
            file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to
            individual files.
          + Centralized backups:
               o Unison now maintains full backups of the
                 last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in
                 each replica; these function both as backups in the
                 usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking
                 external merge programs.
               o The backed up files are stored in a directory
                 /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this
                 directory can be changed by setting the environment
                 variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.)
               o The predicate backup controls which files are actually
                 backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *'
                 causes backing up of all files.
               o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison
                 updates its archive. This means that
                    # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch
                      (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the
                      archive files have been manually deleted), all
                      files will be backed up.
                    # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first
                      time unison propagates an update for it.
               o The preference backupversions controls how many previous
                 versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e.,
                 the last synchronized version plus one backup).
               o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is
                 also still supported, but backup is now preferred.
               o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup
                 directory (or to throw away the directory itself).
                 Before unison uses any of these files for anything
                 important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the
                 one that it expects.
          + Merging:
               o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command,
                 invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected).
               o The actual merging is performed by an external program.
                 The preferences merge and merge2 control how this
                 program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file
                 (see the backup preference), then the merge preference
                 is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In
                 both cases, the value of the preference should be a
                 string representing the command that should be passed to
                 a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string,
                 the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD
                 may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as
                 follows before invoking the command:
                    # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy
                      of the file;
                    # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary
                      file, into which the contents of the remote copy of
                      the file have been transferred by Unison prior to
                      performing the merge;
                    # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file
                      that Unison expects to be written by the merge
                      program when it finishes, giving the desired new
                      contents of the file; and
                    # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy
                      of the original version of the file (i.e., its
                      state at the end of the last successful run of
                      Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not
                      merge2).
                 For example, on Unix systems setting the merge
                 preference to

   merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW
                 will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for
                 merging.
                 A large number of external merging programs are
                 available. For example, emacs users may find the
                 following convenient:

    merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2""
               nil ""NEW"")'
    merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor
               ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")'
                 (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid
                 running off the edge of the page. In your preference
                 file, each should be written on a single line.)
               o If the external program exits without leaving any file
                 at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have
                 failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW
                 but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison
                 considers the merge to have succeeded but to have
                 generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke
                 an external editor so that the user can resolve the
                 conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls
                 what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs.
               o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of
                 the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give
                 several examples in the manual.
     * Smaller changes:
          + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer
            adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a
            file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison
            directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf,
            as it did before. (This change means that included preference
            files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that
            unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file'
            dialog.)
          + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and
            a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger,
            but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't
            depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library
            modules being available.
          + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting
            the propagation direction exactly backwards.
          + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to
            crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does
            not exist.
          + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first
            created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in
            reverse order in the user interface.
     * For developers:
          + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source
            distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective
            developers with navigating the code.
       
   Changes since 2.6.11:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely
       rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is
       that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can
       be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include
       directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath
       in existing profiles should be changed to path.
       Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is
       that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile
       and on the command line.
       You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile
       into two:


  default.prf =
      root = blah
      root = foo
      include common

  common.prf =
      <everything else>
       Now do

  unison common root1 root2
       when you want to specify roots explicitly.
     * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users
       to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be
       propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For
       symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.)
       The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is
       also set.
       The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities
       on a one-off basis via the Actions menu.
     * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be
       relocated without changing the name of the archive file where
       Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for
       experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for
       more information.)
     * Graphical user-interface:
          + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for
            switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from
            scratch.
          + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used
            profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key
            = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will
            cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin
            synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may
            have been selected for a set of changes currently being
            displayed will be discarded.)
          + Each profile may include a preference 'label = <string>'
            giving a descriptive string that described the options
            selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the
            profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed
            in the top-right corner of the main Unison window.
     * Minor:
          + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to
            order the files backwards relative to the main user
            interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.)
          + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check
            the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically
            fall back to the textual user interface.
          + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched
            against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both
            specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be
            skipped.
          + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.6.1:
     * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for
       directories.
     * Preference files may now include lines of the form include <name>,
       which will cause name.prf to be read at that point.
     * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now
       works properly.
     * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that
       the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context.
     * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used
       together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server
       command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd
       preference if there is one, or else just unison.
     * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean
       values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.)
     * Lot of small bugs fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.31:
     * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log
       file seems useful for most users.
     * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks).
       
   Changes since 2.5.25:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again).
     * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.1:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New functionality:
          + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and
            group-ids.
            These new features are controlled by a set of new
            preferences, all of which are currently false by default.
               o When the times preference is set to true, file
                 modification times are propaged. (Because the
                 representations of time may not have the same
                 granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be
                 able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will
                 get them as close as the operating systems involved
                 allow.)
               o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the group preference is set to true, group
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and
                 group information is synchronized numerically. By
                 default, owner and group numbers are converted to names
                 on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The
                 special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never
                 mapped via user/group names even if this preference is
                 not set.)
          + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to
            control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this
            preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should
            be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but
            the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing
            theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to
            synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this
            preference to -1.
          + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison
            keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the
            replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called
            unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the
            HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else,
            set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want
            Unison to use.
          + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of
            patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored,
            whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path
            will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does
            not match any ignorenot patterns.)
     * User-interface improvements:
          + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same
            order as they were given on the command line or in the
            preferences file.
          + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user
            interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it
            displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory
            window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on
            going.
          + Added a new preference for controlling how many status
            messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth
            controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine
            (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory
            paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1.
          + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem
            very useful, and there were too many preferences for
            controlling output in various ways.
          + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one
            that will be used if the user just types <return>) instead of
            all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of
            possibilities.
          + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local
            host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of
            the archive file used to remember which files have been
            synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system
            call. However, if the environment variable
            UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used
            instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations
            where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it
            is a laptop and gets moved around a lot).
          + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail
            window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is
            configured to synchronize them.
     * For hackers:
          + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which
            means we can throw away our local patched version.
            If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources,
            you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers
            release, available from
            http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
            (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit
            challenging.)
          + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been
            cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should
            be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to
            contribute their programming energies. There is also a
            separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs.
          + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being
            maintained and no longer compiles).
          + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional
            information that should be useful for identifying sources of
            problems.
          + The version number of the remote server is now checked right
            away during the connection setup handshake, rather than
            later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that
            turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better
            to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either
            client or server.)
          + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha
            linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these
            architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone
            would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a
            link to them.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive
            when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of
            the replicas is on a windows machine).
          + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during
            propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported
            as having changed during synchronization. This should be
            fixed.
          + Numerous smaller fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.4.1:
     * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By
       default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the
       rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This
       behavior can be changed in the following ways:
          + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly
            created files to be displayed before changed files.
          + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing
            order of size.
          + Giving the preference sortfirst=<pattern> (where <pattern> is
            a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow'
            patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed
            first.
          + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast=<pattern> causes
            paths matching this pattern to be displayed last.
       The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user
       manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed
       from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface.
     * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's
       fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead
       of a synchronizer.
          + Giving the preference prefer with argument <root> (by adding
            -prefer <root> to the command line or prefer=<root>) to your
            profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of
            <root> should be propagated to the other replica (with no
            questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as
            usual.
          + Giving the preference force with argument <root> will make
            unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root,
            even if it was the other replica that was changed.
       These options should be used with care! (More information is
       available in the manual.)
     * Small changes:
          + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in
            the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive).
          + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to
            activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync
            compression is now enabled by default).
          + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which
            direction changes are being propagated are printed
            differently when the user has overridded Unison's default
            recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the
            behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such
            arrows in a different color.
          + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of
            lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility.
          + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual.
       
   Changes since 2.3.12:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New/improved functionality:
          + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which
            changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true,
            the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default
            setting is false.)
          + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to
            be listed before other updates in the user interface.
          + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port.
          + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and
            we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your
            profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified
            without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a
            file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to
            saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access
            saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old
            effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.)
          + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are
            given but no profile is given on the command line. The new
            behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it
            does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The
            manual claimed that this case would work by reading no
            profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true.
          + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always
            listed first
          + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which
            version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal
            values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison
            use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh'
            command.)
          + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the
            same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report
            a spurious conflict)
     * Improvements for the Windows version:
          + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under
            Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior
            is described in the cross-platform section of the manual.
          + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares,
            e.g., //host/drive/path.
          + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in
            Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug:
            Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows.
     * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no
       longer being maintained):
          + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they
            have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's
            default recommendation.
          + More colorful appearance.
          + The initial profile selection window works better.
          + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is
            displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of
            the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the
            top).
          + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of
            total bytes that have been transferred so far.
     * Improvements to the text user interface:
          + The file details will be displayed automatically when a
            conflict is been detected.
          + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left
            over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer
            wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode.
          + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time
            it waits for user interaction.
          + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and
            starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when
            asked whether to propagate changes.
          + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed
            immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more
            questions.
     * Documentation and installation changes:
          + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common
            problems and on tricks contributed by users.
          + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly
            say what are the current stable and beta-test version
            numbers.
          + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers'
            version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at
            any given time!) are now available from the download page.
          + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform
            issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames)
     * Many small bug fixes and random improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.3.1:
     * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module
       that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a
       'rename' error.
       
   Changes since 2.2:
     * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default.
       (It is not stable enough yet.)
     * Various bug fixes.
     * A new experimental feature:
       The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard
       specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on
       the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing
       the contents of that directory.
       Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you
       will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the *
       from being interpreted by your shell.
       If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be
       used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one
       after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first
       in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command
       line or in the preferences file.)
       
   Changes since 2.1:
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain
       Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync
       protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a
       small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs.
       This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on
       fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so
       we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync
       option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on.
     * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers,
       showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far.
     * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be
       have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is
       incremented on every significant public release and the third
       component is the ``patch level.''
     * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface.
     * The manual is now available in PDF format.
     * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport
       subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is
       not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the
       release version of Unison.
       If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need
       to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the
       documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to
       true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with
       the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by
       checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml
       standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the
       end.)
       
   Changes since 1.292:
     * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the
       first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all
       the files in both repositories).
     * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail
       after the client exits.
     * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK
       interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally).
       
   Changes since 1.231:
     * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See
       the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions.
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the
       rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This
       protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of
       a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync
       feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync
       switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do:
       you may not notice much speedup yet.)
     * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem,
       written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still
       single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version,
       you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.)
       Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the
       option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent
       threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded
       clients/servers can interoperate.
     * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques
       Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting
       development effort to the GTK interface from now on.
     * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The
       modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk
       instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you
       must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in
       c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure
       to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by
       default).
     * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use
       unison-<currentversionnumber> instead of just unison as the remote
       server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist
       conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the
       client, the same version will be selected on the server.
       
   Changes since 1.219:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including:
          + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not
            working.
          + umask is now ignored when creating directories
          + directories are create writable, so that a read-only
            directory and its contents can be propagated.
          + Handling of warnings generated by the server.
          + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both
            sides is now flagged as erroneous.
          + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant
            roots.
               o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated
                 onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the
                 link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself,
                 which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the
                 link is completely invisible)
               o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root
                 on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not
                 calculate the working directory into which to write
                 changes. This should be fixed.
     * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive
       files.
     * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond
       better.
     * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going
       back to previous items)
     * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be
       easier to find / download things now.
       
   Changes since 1.200:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows.
     * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the
       same time as the replicas are being changed by the user.
     * Internal performance improvements.
       
   Changes since 1.190:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the
       amount of memory allocation, especially during the first
       synchronization. This should help power users with very big
       replicas.
     * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in
       preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later
       release.
     * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
       
   Changes since 1.180:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns.
     * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from
       working correctly when click-started.
     * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were
       causing spurious reports of different permissions when
       synchronizing between windows and unix systems.
     * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which
       was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large
       replicas.
       
   Changes since 1.169:
     * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files.
     * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing
       functions. Some power users have reported success with very large
       replicas.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored
       automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an
       appropriate ignore pattern in your profile.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has
       changed. Instead of putting a line of the form

                 ignore = <regexp>
       in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put:

                 ignore = Regexp <regexp>
       Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized:

                 ignore = Name <name>
       matches any path in which one component matches <name>, while

                 ignore = Path <path>
       matches exactly the path <path>.
       Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in <name> and
       <path>:
          + a ? matches any single character except /
          + a * matches any sequence of characters not including /
          + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z }
          + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc.
       See the user manual for some examples.
       
   Changes since 1.146:
     * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge
       directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list
       processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please
       give it a try and let us know.
     * Major additions to the documentation.
       
   Changes since 1.142:
     * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes.
     * Major additions to the user manual.
     * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt
       automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots
       to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical
       UI from a desktop icon.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.139:
     * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled
       with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not
       to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've
       heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using
       precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade.
     * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of
       various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module
       XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.111:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files
       in the .unison directory have changed. In particular:
          + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf
          + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into
            default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should
            become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf.
     * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the
       manual for details.
     * You can now have different preference files in your .unison
       directory. If you start unison like this

             unison profilename
       (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the
       file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of
       default.prf.
     * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface
     * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server
       process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using
       sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created
       using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server
       is left running.)
     * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server
       started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This
       may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode
       server has finished initalization.)
     * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development
       tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack
       around with.
     * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make
       Unison better.
       


Changes in Version 2.9.20

   Changes since 2.9.1:
     * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number
       of simultaneous file transfers.
     * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files
       are stored.
     * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes
       when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and
       switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo'
       and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet
       fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks
       will not be synchronized correctly.)
     * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to
       the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The
       reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to
       silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and
       we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to
       other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g.
       synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for
       this suggestion.
     * Several small user interface improvements
     * Documentation
          + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as
            separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web
            page.
          + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance
            tuning.
     * Makefile
          + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk
            automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk
            installed
          + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX
       
   Changes since 2.8.1:
     * Changing profile works again under Windows
     * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy
       instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by
       a boolean option ``xferbycopying''.
     * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data
       transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.]
     * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically
       linked).
     * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and
       Unix
     * Small improvements:
          + If neither the
            tt USERPROFILE nor the
            tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put
            its temporary commit log (called
            tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the
            tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use
            tt C:.
          + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no =
            false; default = auto.
          + -silent implies -contactquietly
     * Source code:
          + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of
            the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific
            stuff can be made available for other projects.)
          + several Makefile and docs changes (for release);
          + further comments in ``update.ml'';
          + connection information is not stored in global variables
            anymore.
       
   Changes since 2.7.78:
     * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid
       leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs
       after Unison exited).
       
   Changes since 2.7.39:
     * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs
       are now both accessible).
     * User manual revised.
     * Added some new preferences:
          + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh
            programs.
          + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server''
            message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI).
     * Bug fixes:
          + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed
            column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to
            change.
          + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop
            if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode.
          + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii
            characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI.
            (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the
            people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii
            filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes
            things.)
          + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was
            reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.)
     * User interface and Unison behavior:
          + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI.
          + Added exit status for the textual user interface.
          + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or
            errors during update detection are now noted in the log file.
          + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format
          + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that
            tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of
            failing.
          + Made some improvements to the error messages.
          + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml.
       
   Changes since 2.7.7:
     * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system.
       It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the
       earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread
       library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight,
       non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This
       version appears stable.
       Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the
       multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to
       the user interface and logging, for example:
          + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the
            beginning, one for the end.
          + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left
            by a previous unison run, because warning does not work
            nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made
            less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by
            the user. They take the form
            .#<filename>.<serial>.unison.tmp.
     * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes
       Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just
       those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked
       as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart
       Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a
       previous run.
     * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the
       initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even
       if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g.,
       when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume
       mounted.)
     * Small improvements and bug fixes:
          + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather
            than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from
            them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these
            warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who
            have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their
            prefs files may now get error reports.
          + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name
            and line number.
          + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to
            the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed
            only in identical ways since last sync.''
          + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference
            files.
          + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first
            marshaled.
          + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously
            changing file: unison will give up after certain number of
            retries.
          + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger
            (force=older preference not working).
     * Compilation:
          + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk
            1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under
            Windows).
          + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform
            with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports
            building dynamically linked unison executables.
       
   Changes since 2.7.4:
     * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup
       sequence.
       
   Changes since 2.7.1:
     * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which
       preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are
       added to.
     * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so
       that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This
       bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to
       tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old
       version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an
       error message.)
       
   Changes since 2.6.59:
     * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal
       values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or
       default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when
       running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is
       default.
     * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All
       preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward
       compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not
       mentioned in the manual any more.
     * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now
       named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than
       appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge
       programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file
       contents.
     * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure
       that the server times out if the communication link is
       unexpectedly broken.
     * Bug fixes:
          + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination
            file.
          + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind
            a followed link.
          + Several other small fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.6.38:
     * Major Windows performance improvement!
       We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at
       a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it
       has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking
       for updates in large replicas.
       When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as
       'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates,
       instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause
       Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time,
       modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the
       update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However,
       Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the
       other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just
       before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this
       switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with
       fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have
       overlooked an update.
       Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested.
       If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what
       Unison is doing.
     * New functionality: centralized backups and merging
          + This version incorporates two pieces of major new
            functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer
            internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps
            a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a
            merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external
            file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to
            individual files.
          + Centralized backups:
               o Unison now maintains full backups of the
                 last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in
                 each replica; these function both as backups in the
                 usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking
                 external merge programs.
               o The backed up files are stored in a directory
                 /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this
                 directory can be changed by setting the environment
                 variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.)
               o The predicate backup controls which files are actually
                 backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *'
                 causes backing up of all files.
               o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison
                 updates its archive. This means that
                    # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch
                      (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the
                      archive files have been manually deleted), all
                      files will be backed up.
                    # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first
                      time unison propagates an update for it.
               o The preference backupversions controls how many previous
                 versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e.,
                 the last synchronized version plus one backup).
               o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is
                 also still supported, but backup is now preferred.
               o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup
                 directory (or to throw away the directory itself).
                 Before unison uses any of these files for anything
                 important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the
                 one that it expects.
          + Merging:
               o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command,
                 invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected).
               o The actual merging is performed by an external program.
                 The preferences merge and merge2 control how this
                 program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file
                 (see the backup preference), then the merge preference
                 is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In
                 both cases, the value of the preference should be a
                 string representing the command that should be passed to
                 a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string,
                 the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD
                 may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as
                 follows before invoking the command:
                    # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy
                      of the file;
                    # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary
                      file, into which the contents of the remote copy of
                      the file have been transferred by Unison prior to
                      performing the merge;
                    # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file
                      that Unison expects to be written by the merge
                      program when it finishes, giving the desired new
                      contents of the file; and
                    # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy
                      of the original version of the file (i.e., its
                      state at the end of the last successful run of
                      Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not
                      merge2).
                 For example, on Unix systems setting the merge
                 preference to

   merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW
                 will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for
                 merging.
                 A large number of external merging programs are
                 available. For example, emacs users may find the
                 following convenient:

    merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2""
               nil ""NEW"")'
    merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor
               ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")'
                 (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid
                 running off the edge of the page. In your preference
                 file, each should be written on a single line.)
               o If the external program exits without leaving any file
                 at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have
                 failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW
                 but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison
                 considers the merge to have succeeded but to have
                 generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke
                 an external editor so that the user can resolve the
                 conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls
                 what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs.
               o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of
                 the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give
                 several examples in the manual.
     * Smaller changes:
          + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer
            adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a
            file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison
            directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf,
            as it did before. (This change means that included preference
            files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that
            unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file'
            dialog.)
          + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and
            a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger,
            but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't
            depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library
            modules being available.
          + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting
            the propagation direction exactly backwards.
          + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to
            crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does
            not exist.
          + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first
            created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in
            reverse order in the user interface.
     * For developers:
          + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source
            distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective
            developers with navigating the code.
       
   Changes since 2.6.11:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely
       rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is
       that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can
       be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include
       directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath
       in existing profiles should be changed to path.
       Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is
       that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile
       and on the command line.
       You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile
       into two:


  default.prf =
      root = blah
      root = foo
      include common

  common.prf =
      <everything else>
       Now do

  unison common root1 root2
       when you want to specify roots explicitly.
     * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users
       to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be
       propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For
       symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.)
       The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is
       also set.
       The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities
       on a one-off basis via the Actions menu.
     * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be
       relocated without changing the name of the archive file where
       Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for
       experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for
       more information.)
     * Graphical user-interface:
          + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for
            switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from
            scratch.
          + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used
            profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key
            = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will
            cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin
            synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may
            have been selected for a set of changes currently being
            displayed will be discarded.)
          + Each profile may include a preference 'label = <string>'
            giving a descriptive string that described the options
            selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the
            profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed
            in the top-right corner of the main Unison window.
     * Minor:
          + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to
            order the files backwards relative to the main user
            interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.)
          + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check
            the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically
            fall back to the textual user interface.
          + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched
            against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both
            specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be
            skipped.
          + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.6.1:
     * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for
       directories.
     * Preference files may now include lines of the form include <name>,
       which will cause name.prf to be read at that point.
     * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now
       works properly.
     * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that
       the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context.
     * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used
       together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server
       command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd
       preference if there is one, or else just unison.
     * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean
       values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.)
     * Lot of small bugs fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.31:
     * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log
       file seems useful for most users.
     * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks).
       
   Changes since 2.5.25:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again).
     * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.1:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New functionality:
          + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and
            group-ids.
            These new features are controlled by a set of new
            preferences, all of which are currently false by default.
               o When the times preference is set to true, file
                 modification times are propaged. (Because the
                 representations of time may not have the same
                 granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be
                 able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will
                 get them as close as the operating systems involved
                 allow.)
               o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the group preference is set to true, group
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and
                 group information is synchronized numerically. By
                 default, owner and group numbers are converted to names
                 on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The
                 special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never
                 mapped via user/group names even if this preference is
                 not set.)
          + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to
            control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this
            preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should
            be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but
            the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing
            theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to
            synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this
            preference to -1.
          + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison
            keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the
            replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called
            unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the
            HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else,
            set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want
            Unison to use.
          + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of
            patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored,
            whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path
            will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does
            not match any ignorenot patterns.)
     * User-interface improvements:
          + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same
            order as they were given on the command line or in the
            preferences file.
          + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user
            interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it
            displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory
            window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on
            going.
          + Added a new preference for controlling how many status
            messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth
            controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine
            (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory
            paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1.
          + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem
            very useful, and there were too many preferences for
            controlling output in various ways.
          + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one
            that will be used if the user just types <return>) instead of
            all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of
            possibilities.
          + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local
            host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of
            the archive file used to remember which files have been
            synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system
            call. However, if the environment variable
            UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used
            instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations
            where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it
            is a laptop and gets moved around a lot).
          + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail
            window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is
            configured to synchronize them.
     * For hackers:
          + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which
            means we can throw away our local patched version.
            If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources,
            you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers
            release, available from
            http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
            (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit
            challenging.)
          + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been
            cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should
            be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to
            contribute their programming energies. There is also a
            separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs.
          + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being
            maintained and no longer compiles).
          + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional
            information that should be useful for identifying sources of
            problems.
          + The version number of the remote server is now checked right
            away during the connection setup handshake, rather than
            later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that
            turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better
            to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either
            client or server.)
          + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha
            linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these
            architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone
            would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a
            link to them.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive
            when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of
            the replicas is on a windows machine).
          + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during
            propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported
            as having changed during synchronization. This should be
            fixed.
          + Numerous smaller fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.4.1:
     * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By
       default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the
       rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This
       behavior can be changed in the following ways:
          + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly
            created files to be displayed before changed files.
          + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing
            order of size.
          + Giving the preference sortfirst=<pattern> (where <pattern> is
            a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow'
            patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed
            first.
          + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast=<pattern> causes
            paths matching this pattern to be displayed last.
       The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user
       manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed
       from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface.
     * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's
       fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead
       of a synchronizer.
          + Giving the preference prefer with argument <root> (by adding
            -prefer <root> to the command line or prefer=<root>) to your
            profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of
            <root> should be propagated to the other replica (with no
            questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as
            usual.
          + Giving the preference force with argument <root> will make
            unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root,
            even if it was the other replica that was changed.
       These options should be used with care! (More information is
       available in the manual.)
     * Small changes:
          + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in
            the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive).
          + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to
            activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync
            compression is now enabled by default).
          + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which
            direction changes are being propagated are printed
            differently when the user has overridded Unison's default
            recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the
            behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such
            arrows in a different color.
          + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of
            lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility.
          + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual.
       
   Changes since 2.3.12:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New/improved functionality:
          + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which
            changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true,
            the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default
            setting is false.)
          + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to
            be listed before other updates in the user interface.
          + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port.
          + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and
            we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your
            profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified
            without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a
            file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to
            saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access
            saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old
            effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.)
          + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are
            given but no profile is given on the command line. The new
            behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it
            does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The
            manual claimed that this case would work by reading no
            profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true.
          + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always
            listed first
          + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which
            version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal
            values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison
            use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh'
            command.)
          + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the
            same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report
            a spurious conflict)
     * Improvements for the Windows version:
          + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under
            Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior
            is described in the cross-platform section of the manual.
          + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares,
            e.g., //host/drive/path.
          + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in
            Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug:
            Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows.
     * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no
       longer being maintained):
          + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they
            have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's
            default recommendation.
          + More colorful appearance.
          + The initial profile selection window works better.
          + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is
            displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of
            the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the
            top).
          + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of
            total bytes that have been transferred so far.
     * Improvements to the text user interface:
          + The file details will be displayed automatically when a
            conflict is been detected.
          + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left
            over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer
            wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode.
          + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time
            it waits for user interaction.
          + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and
            starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when
            asked whether to propagate changes.
          + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed
            immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more
            questions.
     * Documentation and installation changes:
          + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common
            problems and on tricks contributed by users.
          + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly
            say what are the current stable and beta-test version
            numbers.
          + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers'
            version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at
            any given time!) are now available from the download page.
          + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform
            issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames)
     * Many small bug fixes and random improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.3.1:
     * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module
       that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a
       'rename' error.
       
   Changes since 2.2:
     * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default.
       (It is not stable enough yet.)
     * Various bug fixes.
     * A new experimental feature:
       The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard
       specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on
       the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing
       the contents of that directory.
       Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you
       will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the *
       from being interpreted by your shell.
       If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be
       used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one
       after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first
       in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command
       line or in the preferences file.)
       
   Changes since 2.1:
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain
       Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync
       protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a
       small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs.
       This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on
       fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so
       we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync
       option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on.
     * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers,
       showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far.
     * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be
       have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is
       incremented on every significant public release and the third
       component is the ``patch level.''
     * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface.
     * The manual is now available in PDF format.
     * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport
       subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is
       not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the
       release version of Unison.
       If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need
       to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the
       documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to
       true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with
       the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by
       checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml
       standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the
       end.)
       
   Changes since 1.292:
     * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the
       first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all
       the files in both repositories).
     * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail
       after the client exits.
     * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK
       interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally).
       
   Changes since 1.231:
     * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See
       the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions.
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the
       rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This
       protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of
       a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync
       feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync
       switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do:
       you may not notice much speedup yet.)
     * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem,
       written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still
       single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version,
       you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.)
       Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the
       option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent
       threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded
       clients/servers can interoperate.
     * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques
       Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting
       development effort to the GTK interface from now on.
     * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The
       modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk
       instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you
       must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in
       c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure
       to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by
       default).
     * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use
       unison-<currentversionnumber> instead of just unison as the remote
       server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist
       conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the
       client, the same version will be selected on the server.
       
   Changes since 1.219:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including:
          + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not
            working.
          + umask is now ignored when creating directories
          + directories are create writable, so that a read-only
            directory and its contents can be propagated.
          + Handling of warnings generated by the server.
          + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both
            sides is now flagged as erroneous.
          + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant
            roots.
               o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated
                 onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the
                 link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself,
                 which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the
                 link is completely invisible)
               o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root
                 on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not
                 calculate the working directory into which to write
                 changes. This should be fixed.
     * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive
       files.
     * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond
       better.
     * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going
       back to previous items)
     * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be
       easier to find / download things now.
       
   Changes since 1.200:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows.
     * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the
       same time as the replicas are being changed by the user.
     * Internal performance improvements.
       
   Changes since 1.190:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the
       amount of memory allocation, especially during the first
       synchronization. This should help power users with very big
       replicas.
     * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in
       preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later
       release.
     * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
       
   Changes since 1.180:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns.
     * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from
       working correctly when click-started.
     * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were
       causing spurious reports of different permissions when
       synchronizing between windows and unix systems.
     * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which
       was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large
       replicas.
       
   Changes since 1.169:
     * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files.
     * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing
       functions. Some power users have reported success with very large
       replicas.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored
       automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an
       appropriate ignore pattern in your profile.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has
       changed. Instead of putting a line of the form

                 ignore = <regexp>
       in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put:

                 ignore = Regexp <regexp>
       Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized:

                 ignore = Name <name>
       matches any path in which one component matches <name>, while

                 ignore = Path <path>
       matches exactly the path <path>.
       Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in <name> and
       <path>:
          + a ? matches any single character except /
          + a * matches any sequence of characters not including /
          + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z }
          + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc.
       See the user manual for some examples.
       
   Changes since 1.146:
     * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge
       directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list
       processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please
       give it a try and let us know.
     * Major additions to the documentation.
       
   Changes since 1.142:
     * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes.
     * Major additions to the user manual.
     * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt
       automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots
       to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical
       UI from a desktop icon.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.139:
     * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled
       with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not
       to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've
       heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using
       precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade.
     * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of
       various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module
       XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.111:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files
       in the .unison directory have changed. In particular:
          + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf
          + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into
            default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should
            become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf.
     * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the
       manual for details.
     * You can now have different preference files in your .unison
       directory. If you start unison like this

             unison profilename
       (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the
       file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of
       default.prf.
     * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface
     * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server
       process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using
       sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created
       using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server
       is left running.)
     * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server
       started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This
       may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode
       server has finished initalization.)
     * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development
       tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack
       around with.
     * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make
       Unison better.

Subject: Aussie paper: US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen
  spies

Anybody ever heard of Pavlik Morozov? (If not see 
http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/morozov.html for a quick blurb about the 
fellow.) When I see proposals to mobilize American people into being eyes 
and ears fo the government, I am reminded of Pavilik and his family.

Now I am not against people reporting certain things to the police. It is 
the habit of being constantly suspicious of neighbors, co-workers, and 
otehrs that can become destructive. Down the line it can lead to suspicions 
based not on significant clues but upon things such as ""fails to display 
sufficient respect for authority"", ""laughs whenever the phrase 'homeland 
security' is used"", and ""hangs out with anti-social misfits."" It is an all 
too easy slide from neighbors watching out for each and helping the 
community to becoming agents of the state.

US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies
By Ritt Goldstein
July 15 2002

The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens 
as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.

The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will 
have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany 
through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum 
of 4 per cent of Americans to report ""suspicious activity"".

Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier 
this year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale 
investigations of US citizens.

As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war 
against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.

Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are 
being recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to 
homes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees, 
truck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted recruits.

A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov, 
is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants 
participating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the 
10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total 
population of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.

How did you fix it? By creating the pidfile as the ""-u"" user?
If so, you should add this to the documentation since it prevents
the use of the standard /var/run directory (which is only writable
by root).

spamassassin mailbox delivery problem,Frank Burkhardt <burk@cns.mpg.de>,yyyy@spamassassin.taint.org,"Wed, 21 Aug 2002 11:17:46 +0200","Hi,

when testing spamassassin, i found a little problem but
I don't know if it's spamassassin or my pop3-server
that caused it.

Pop3-servers seem to expect a blank line before ""From ""-lines
to seperate mails in a mailbox-file.
Spamassassin does not add such a blank line before
mails delivered directly to mailbox.
Result is that the pop3-server (tested with qpopper4 and
cucipop) delivers some mails glued together.

I think the solution is to write a blank line to the mailbox
befor spamassassin adds the filtered mail.

Please tell me if you're not the right man for this,
 if i'm totally wrong or if you're sure, the pop3-server
 shouldn't insist on a blank line before ""From ""-lines.

Thank you.

PS: Mailserver ist postfix-1.1.11

Remember that the GA is going to be considering combinatorial 
uses of the rules, so rules which look dodgy on their own might 
be gems for the GA -- perhaps something with a S/O ratio of .5 
actually occurs often in combination with some other rule, and 
in those situations, helps to distinguish spam vs nonspam.

                              here falls shoe two

         Well, it's getting late, and the government hasn't fallen,
         so we better roll the presses on the bad news. The CAMPAIGN
         FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS published its first in-depth analysis of
         the EUCD. For this exciting installment, CD-R has
         concentrated on what it does to people who have to
         circumvent copy protection to do their job. The short
         summary is: if they're not a teacher, a prison warder,
         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. If you're
         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the
         copy protection says you can't make a backup, you can't. And
         even if you *are* a teacher or other exceptional person,
         you'll have to ask the Secretary of State if you can crack
         the protected CD. In writing. Each time.
         http://uk.eurorights.org/issues/eucd/ukimpl/

                                   - what you can do to stop all this

         But there's plenty more to ooze out of the law than that.
         One of the big questions about the EUCD is ""is it the
         European DMCA, or what?"". Well, the DMCA spurted bad juice
         in many different directions, but one way in which the two
         are similiar is over ""circumvention devices"". Distributing
         DeCSS, the DVD lobby have claimed, is a crime under the
         DMCA. DeCSS is code that was also a magically dangerous
         artifact: a circumvention device. Circumvention devices are
         about to become illegal here. Specifically, three months in
         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for
         those who ""distribute otherwise than in the course of a
         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the
         copyright owner"" one of them. ""Otherwise in the course of
         business"" is legalese for ""as an ordinary punter"", so it's
         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. Anyone who
         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.

         That's not going to go down well with ANDREW SIMMONS.
         Regular NTK readers will remember Andrew as a lightning rod
         to lawyers. Not only was he John Doe #13 in the American
         DeCSS case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws
         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing
         his list of doomed dotcoms on his Website [NTK 2000-09-22].
         In the last week, he's had another letter via Demon, finally
         ordering him to remove his shiny ""circumvention device"" (aka
         DeCSS) from his site. It sounds like the lawyers may have
         shot their wad a tad early: the EUCD rules don't kick in
         until Christmas. But when the new laws do hit, and if what
         Andrew's preposterous correspondent says is believed in a UK
         court, hosting DeCSS *will* mean jail. There's been some
         talk about how the EUCD rules are better than the DMCA,
         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the
         new rules. Well, it looks like DeCSS is no longer just a
         computer program. From now on, it could become a special ""nick me""
         tag for your Website.

         The crazy counterintuitive conditional probability world of
         BAYES THEOREM has a reputation for making judges look stupid
         in DNA-testing murder cases, and search-engines look even
         stupider when they suggest ""relevant documents"" - but it's
         getting a bit of a re-renaissance in the spam filtering
         world. Tradition states Naive Bayesian alone doesn't work
         well enough at filtering by example, so it's good to see
         dozens of people independently sloshing around the noospere
         looking for better tweaked solutions. Including, of course,
         leading noosphere cadet ERIC S RAYMOND, whose Bayesian
         BOGOFILTER is fast, has extra smarts, and is up to version

         configurator and recent anti-gay anti-islam anti-vegetable
         rants, it requires taking on board just a *bit* too
         much extra baggage to really take off. Rennies' IFILE around
         has been around for a while, and has support for MH and

         and now features lengthy explanations of exactly what PayPal

         designs now available in XXL, including the ever-popular 404

         photographed by THE NORTHERN ECHO about his trip to see
         ""Attack Of The Clones"" open in LA. Even though this was only a
         local newspaper, the judging panel felt he deserved the full
         prize (of another t-shirt), as the story goes on to cover the
         ostensibly pointless nature of the entire exercise. That's the

Defcon key-signing party,Mark Renouf <mark@tweakt.net>,Cypherpunks <cypherpunks@lne.com>,"Wed, 24 Jul 2002 09:05:23 -0400","Anyone interested in a pgp/gpg key-signing get-together @ DC,
please email me your key info (name, key ID, type, size,
fingerprint), and I will add you to the list.

If you don't have a PGP key, now is a great time to make one.

Want to find out more about PGP?
<http://www.uk.pgp.net/pgpnet/pgp-faq/>

You can get the software from:

PGPfreeware <http://www.pgpi.org/products/pgp/versions/freeware/>
GnuPG (GPG) <http://www.pgpi.org/download/gnupg/>


Bring the following:

   *  Photo ID (your name must be in your key identity)
   *  A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key size

I will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then
individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys.

It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from
their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key
information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID
for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then
person B can check off that person on their list.

The reverse is then done for person B.

After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked
names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a
keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the
checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using
your private key.

Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a
copy back to the key's owner to add to thier keyring.

If your using spamd and you want your users to have some control using
user_prefs then check their ~/spamassassin file.
If your using spamd and you have a site wide only policy then make sure that
spamd is started with the -x option.
If you used the -x option then the only place that it should get the rules from
would be from the local.cf in the /etc/mail/spamassassin directory. Assuming a

or, alternatively, giveaway patterns in the HTML?  That's what's happening
with most obfuscating techniques the spammers are trying -- they become
a very reliable sign of spam in themselves!

[VulnWatch] Remote hole in Codeblue log scanner,Demi Sex God from Hell <doe@orbital.wiretapped.net>,vulnwatch@vulnwatch.org,"Thu, 25 Jul 2002 02:05:00 +1000","TITLE: Potential remote root in CodeBlue log scanner

DATE: YES, PLEASE MAIL ME IF YOU ARE FEMALE (send pictures)
CRAZY TRACKING NUMBER THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE SOME MASSIVE DATABASE OF
JUAREZ: 7363A64B02

Props to dme@#!

Information
-----------

you may remember me from sweaty nights of passion, or perhaps from yesterday when
i announced the release of a piece of software i wrote (many years ago too
btw).

in general i received no feedback from this, cept from one guy having problems
downloading it (howd that go btw?) and then this:

From: ""Michael""
To: ""'Demi Sex God from Hell'""
Subject: RE: ass the attack spoofing shell

Annoying. Pointless.

well! how very very rude. that really was uncalled for. (propz to dme yo!).
gay, bi or curious, i went to find out more about mystical michael, who is
obviously very important as he is the only one who felt the need to tell me
they didnt like me. it turns out, hes a bit of programmer, with some code
available on his website (www.tenebrous.com). I got codeblue, (btw mystical
mike your auto-download script for you counter gives me a 500 error), a log
checking utility mystical mike wrote and released under the GNU GPL to make
the world a better place.

If this tool is run as root (say nightly from roots crontab) there is a
potential remote root. in any case, regardless of user, there is
always a remote. if codeblue is locally suid, theres many overflows all
throughout it, easy peasy like the girls in st patricks!!!.

Note st patricks is a great place in sydney, playground of the rich and
famous. visit it if you ever visit sydney, tell them i sent you.

so lets have a walk through the code, and get a feel for mystical mike, the
man behind the mystic. (do you wear a crazy robe with a hood like a monk
mike?)

	/* whoops! */


Now, all this is good for a laugh, but unless its suid, not much use :(

CodeBlue will scan apache/squid logfiles looking for code red and nimda log
hits. If it finds a hit, it will connect to the source ip adress of the hit
and send an email warning of infection. Unfortunately, mystical mike was too
far up on his high horse to write something decent.

The function that does this is send_email() (line ~552)

It starts off like this:

int send_email(void)
{
	int sd;
	char *host = malloc(sizeof(char) * 512);

/*  .... silly crap using popen and stuff .... */

	/* host is the infected host from the logfiles
 	 * this will connect to the host on port 25
	 */

    if ((sd = smtp_connect(host)) < SUCCESS)
        return -1;

/* Step 0 - Get initial server response */
    get_smtp_reply(sd);

[ILUG] NFS slowness with SuSE 8.1,Niall O Broin <niall@linux.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,"Tue, 26 Nov 2002 16:12:12 +0000","NFS as a protocol is not known for its speediness but this is absurd. I did an 
NFS install of a box this morning (that would be the box which won't boot 
from CD for those who were in IRC) and it was rather slow but I just left it 
to it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it 
handy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted 
the NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying. 

After a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE. 
So I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about 
100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS 
rate. Any ideas as to what's making it SO slow ? There's really no point in 
running more nfsd processes, as there is exactly one client, so I'm a little 
at a loss I must say.

A bizarre collection of stuffed animals could fetch up to £2m when it is
sold by a Cornwall museum.
The Museum of Curiosities is home to a menagerie of 10,000 Victorian stuffed
animals.
The museum, next to the Jamaica Inn on Bodmin Moor, gets about 30,000
visitors a year.
But now the inn's owner Kevin Moore has decided to sell.

Stuffed frogs are for sale

Mr Moore said: ""It was very fashionable to have taxidermy on your
mantlepiece in Victorian times, but it is not really in favour now.""
Nevertheless, figures of up to £2m for the collection have been discussed.
The museum was opened in 1861 by taxidermist Walter Potter.
Tableaux include a kittens tea party, cricket-playing guinea pigs and
swinging frogs.

I don't think I could argue that ZODB is more reliable that
BerkeleyDB.  It's true that we have fewer database experts and expend
fewer resources working on database reliability.  On the other hand,
Barry is nearly finished with a BerkeleyDB-based storage for ZODB.

ZODB is an object persistence tool that uses a database behind it.
You can use our FileStorage or you can use someone else's database,
although BerkeleyDB is the best we can offer at the moment.  (It would
be really cool to do a Postgres storage...)

This sounds like a Zope complaint that doesn't have anything to do
with ZODB, but maybe I misunderstand you.  You don't have to store
your code in the database, although that will be mostly possible in
ZODB4.

Seriously, ZODB stores object pickles in a database.  The storage
layer is free to manage those pickles however it likes.  FileStorage
uses a single file.  Toby Dickenson's DirectoryStorage represents each
pickle as a separate file.

  SM> * It seems to grow without bound, else why do I need to pack my
  SM>       Data.fs file every now and then?

It grows without bound unless you pack it.  Why is that a problem? 
BerkeleyDB log files grow without bound, too.  Databases require some
tending.  One possibility with FileStorage is to add an explicit
pack() call to update training operation.  We'd need to think
carefully about the performance impact.

I think we'd want a spambayes installer that packaged up spambayes,

I haven't used ZODB much really but it sure looks like the Right Way.  I
don't think it will fly with the unwashed Unix masses, but it sounds
like a piece of cake with the Windows crowd.  That makes sense; you only
have one OS vendor and one processor family to support.

RE: [ILUG] NVIDIA and Debian Woody,Conor_D_Wynne@Dell.com,ilug@linux.ie,"Wed, 04 Dec 2002 04:05:38 -0600","Hi there,

Now this is probably of no use to you whatsoever, but...

Not a deb-head, but I also have a problem regards NVidia. I've two machines,
pretty much the same hardware. 
athlon 1700XP's, both have NVidia cards, one Gforce3 Ti and a Gforce2MX,
both use the same driver module. 

Both have same kernel version albeit it compiled for their particular
hardware.

One works perfectly, the other fails to load. When I check with lsmod, I can
see the NVdriver is loaded, but not used ;--(
Thus when I startx, it bombs out. 

IU still have X with the default nv driver and crappy accelleration -->
650fps with glxgears [should be over 2000fps]
Its not a hardware issue with the cards as I swapped them over and get the
same symptoms. 

I reckon my mobo is cack, I've tried swapping slots around, reserving
resources etc all to no avail. 
Should there be an interrupt for the nv card? I haven't checked the other
box yet.

CW

If X is working and you get a brief Nvidia splash screen then this is
likely nothing to do with the driver itself.  You should be able to use kdm
or gdm with the nvidia Xserver.  What exactly did you change in your
XF86Config?  Will gdm/kdm not start?

Well, this sounds like the NVIDIA kernel module isn't loading on boot.
When it *is* working do a quick 

/sbin/lsmod

and look for the module name (something like 'NVDriver').  Then put this on
a new line in 

/etc/modules

in order that linux will load it on boot.  You can just do

modprobe nvdriver

to load it by hand.  Your make install did this as well as reinstalling the
driver in /lib etc.  You should also get a message saying loading the
nvidia driver taints your kernel (which it does, in the sense that it's not
open source).

> Is this a problem anyone else has encountered and what is the best

The nvidia driver source is in the Woody tree.

http://packages.debian.org/stable/x11/nvidia-kernel-src.html

so you can do

apt-get install nvidia-kernel-src

and then compile, although I've always gone the route you're doing now.

Ideally the nvidia driver would be a part of the kernel from day 1.
However, nvidia have not open sourced it (most of the above source is
pre-compiled object code), but in order for it to work with your specific
kernel you must compile against your kernel headers (as you did).  As
debian has lots of potential kernels they can't have one nvdriver package
and have chosen instead to provide the source.  Actually I don't know if
they're permitted to distribute binaries by nvidia's license anyway.
